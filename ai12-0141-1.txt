!summary

Add raise expressions to the list in paragraph 57.16/3 of the introduction
!question

The Introduction, paragraph 57.16/3 describes the kinds of expressions added by
Ada 2012. AI12-0022-1 added raise expressions, which is another kind of expression
associated with Ada 2012. Should it be mentioned in the Introduction? (Yes.)

!recommendation

(See Summary.)

!wording

Modify Introduction (57.16/3):

New forms of expressions are introduced. These are if expressions, case expressions,
quantified expressions, [and ]expression functions{, and raise expressions}. As
well as being useful for programming in general by avoiding the introduction of
unnecessary assignments, they are especially valuable in conditions and invariants
since they avoid the need to introduce auxiliary functions. See subclauses 4.5.7,
4.5.8, [and ]6.8{, and 11.3}. Membership tests are also made more flexible. See
subclauses 4.4 and 4.5.2.

!discussion

None of the other changes of the corrigendum seem worth mentioning in the
Introduction.

[Editor's note: Should we modify 57.15/3: "invariants for private types {and
interfaces}"? Should we add 13.11.3 to the references at the end of the last
sentence of 57.18/3 (to include pragma/aspect Default_Storage_Pool)?]
