!subject Import of variadic C functions
!summary

A new convention, C_Variadic_*N* is introduced to handle C functions with variable
numbers of parameters.

!question

B.3(75) contains the following statement: "10  A C function that takes a
variable number of arguments can correspond to several Ada subprograms, taking
various specific numbers and types of parameters.".

This is only true for ABIs where the regular C calling convention is
the same as the calling convention used for variadic C functions. On systems
using the System V ABI AMD64 (used e.g. on 64bit Linux, see
http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/abi.pdf) the calling conventions are
different, which leads to unpredictable results when importing variadic C
functions.

Should this note should be rewritten or deleted? (Yes.)

Should Ada have some standard way of interfacing to variadic C functions? (Yes.)

!recommendation

(See summary.)

!wording

In B.3(1/3) replace
    ... and support for specifying the Convention aspect
    with *convention* identifiers C and C_Pass_By_Copy.
with
    ... and support for specifying the Convention aspect
    with *convention* identifiers C, C_Pass_By_Copy, and
    any of the C_Variadic_*N* conventions described below.

Append after B.3(60.15/3)

    For some implementation-dependent integer M greater than or equal
    to 16, the identifiers C_Variadic_0, C_Variadic_1, C_Variadic_2,
    and on up to C_Variadic_*M* are convention identifiers. These
    conventions are said to be *C_Variadic*. The convention
    C_Variadic_*n* is the calling convention for a variadic C function
    taking *n* fixed parameters and then a variable number of
    additional parameters. The C_Variadic_*n* convention shall only
    be specified as the convention aspect for a subprogram, or for an
    access-to-subprogram type, having at least *n* parameters. A type
    is compatible with a C_Variadic convention if and only if the type is
    C-compatible. Specifying a C_Variadic convention for a type has
    the same effect on the representation of the type as specifying a
    convention of C (i.e., the type is represented according to the
    conventions of the supported C implementation).

In B.3(75). replace
   "A C function that takes a variable number of arguments"
with
   "A variadic C function"

!discussion

This AI is classified as a Binding Interpretation, applying to Ada 2012.
Note that adding a language name is something that any implementation can do,
so Ada 95 and Ada 2005 compilers also can implement the solution.
As such the classification does not matter that much,
but it seems better to encourage adoption in Ada 2005 compilers (else it is
impossible to write portable interfaces without resorting to writing C code,
which should never be required lest programmers wonder why they're using Ada at
all).

!topic Problematic wording regarding the import of variadic C functions

!discussion

B.3(75) contains the following statement: "10  A C function that takes a
variable number of arguments can correspond to several Ada subprograms, taking
various specific numbers and types of parameters. ".

Currently this is only true for ABIs where the regular C calling convention is
the same as the calling convention used for variadic C functions. On systems
using the System V ABI AMD64 (used e.g. on 64bit Linux, see
http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/abi.pdf) the calling conventions are
different, which leads to unpredictable results when importing variadic C
functions.

Possible solution 1: Amend B.3(75) with a warning that this only works on ABIs
where the calling convention for variadic C functions is the same as for regular
C functions.

Possible solution 2: As an implementation advice in B.3, add a new import
convention (e.g. `C_Varargs' or `C_Variadic') which allows to explicitly specify
a different calling convention for variadic C functions. This new calling
convention of course should map to `C' on ABIs where `C_Varargs' and `C' are
identical.

Thanks for bringing this to our attention.

I would agree that a special "convention" might be the best way to handle this.
However, in some cases just using, for example, C_Varargs as the convention,
might not provide enough information, as perhaps it is necessary to know where
the varargs part starts.

However, it sounds like the AMD64 ABI for varargs doesn't need anything more
than a count provided in the %al register.  Here is a quote from the ABI
document:

     ... %al does not need to match exactly the number of
     vector registers, but must be an upper bound on
     the number of vector registers used and is in the
     range 0-8 inclusive.

So setting it to 8 will always work, apparently, through presumably incur a
heavier overhead, so even a simple-minded compiler could get something that
worked, seeing only a calling convention of, say, C_Varargs.

For now, the recommendation in the GNAT user manual seems like the correct
approach.  That is, create a wrapper function in C that takes a fixed number of
arguments, and then have that call the variadic function.

As long as the compiler doesn't use the vector registers (which I think is the
case for GNAT), just setting %al to 0 also works without resulting in a possible
performance degradation.

But that wasn't really the point of my mail. I think it is problematic that the
Ada standard seems to imply by B.3(75) that variadic C functions can be called
by using various Ada overloads and a simple import pragma. And this should be
fixed some way or another.

Providing an official way to import variadic C function of course would be the
best solution, but even replacing B.3(75) by a statement that explicitly warns
that variadic C functions in general cannot be imported in this way (or perhaps
use a wording similar to the one in the GNAT user guide) would be an improvement
over the current wording, in my opinion.

On the other hand, B.3(75) has been unmodified since the original Ada 83
standard, and perhaps it's more a problem with my reading of the standard than a
problem with the standard itself.

Actually, there was no B.3(75) before Ada 95.

In any case, it is only relatively recently that this became a problem.
In old versions of C, function prototypes were completely optional, so even the
C compiler didn't know it was calling a variadic function.  C++ always required
prototypes, but the compilers still attempted to use calling conventions that
didn't take advantage of this for many years (actually, for decades).
Apparently when they designed the ABI for the X86-64 architecture, they finally
decided to require prototypes, even for C.

So I think this was correct as written until relatively recently, and
unfortunately, no one pointed out this problem during the Ada 2012 revision
process.  We can only fix problems we know about!  This is certainly a good
candidate for a fix to the standard, but it will be a while before there is
another "official" Ada standard, so hopefully we can get the word out that
variadic functions may require special handling.

Yes, you are right of course, B.3(75) was added for Ada 95. Sorry for the
thinko.

Is there anything else I need to do that this issue stays on the radar of the
ARG?

No, Randy Brukardt is very diligent about creating official "AI"s if the issue
is substantive, and this one seems to be so.  Official AIs are tracked very
carefully and pop up next time we have an ARG meeting.

C compilers use different calling conventions for functions with and without
prototypes.  Historically, a prototype-less declaration had to be matched with
an old-style function definition.  The default argument promotions (such as
conversion from float to double) are automatically applied when you call a
function without a prototype. For variadic functions with prototypes, default
argument promotions are applied only for the optional arguments.  This can be
compensated for on the Ada by using promoted types there.  But prototypes had an
ABI impact right from the beginning.

With the x86_64 psABI (and apparently, the Windows amd64 ABI), it is
insufficient to apply the default argument promotions manually.  This is indeed
a difference.  But a knowledge when to apply default argument promotions would
still help Ada compilers to detect incorrect interface declarations.  Knowing
the number of fixed arguments is needed for that, too.
