!subject Use subtype_indication in generalized iterators
!summary

An anonymous access declaration can be specified in an array component iterator
if necessary to match the component subtype.

An optional subtype_indication can be provided with a generalized iterator.

!problem

One of the important features of Ada is that in almost all cases, the type
of an object appears at the place where the object is declared. Thus it is not
necessary to follow chains of declaration to find the type and subtype of an
object.

Traditional for loops are the exception to this feature, as the type of I does
not appear in "for I in 1 .. 10 loop". Here, however, the type is assumed, and
Ada programmers quickly get used to that.

The reason for allowing the loop parameter to be specified for array component
iterators and for component element iterators is to preserve this principle (at
least optionally). Traditional for loops did not need such an option because the
subtype is drawn directly from the given subtype_indication - the only thing
that is missing is the colon.

However, there are two holes in this support:

(1) The syntax for array component iterators is:

   defining_identifier [: subtype_indication] of [reverse] iterable_name

However, the syntax for the definition of the component subtype of an array
type includes access_definition. Given our zeal for allowing anonymous access
everywhere, it's odd that we're not allowing it here. As noted above, it's
valuable that every declaration have its type easily determinable. And we
already have rules to allow different anonymous access types to statically
match, so there is no problem with allowing anonymous access here.

(2) The name of the cursor subtype does not appear anywhere in a generalized
iterator. Again, a search through a chain of declarations is needed to
find the name of this subtype (it will be found as the actual subtype in the
instantiation of Ada.Iterator_Interfaces, so a minimum of three searches will
be needed).

In order to be consistent with the other new kinds of iterators, we need to
allow specifying the subtype in the case of a generalized iterator.

!wording

Replace 5.5.2(2/3) with: (Note: square and curly brackets as in syntax, not
                          wording modifications)
 iterator_specification ::= 
    defining_identifier [: loop_parameter_subtype_indication] in [reverse] iterator_name
  | defining_identifier [: loop_parameter_subtype_indication] of [reverse] iterable_name
 loop_parameter_subtype_indication ::= subtype_indication | access_definition

Add to the start of 5.5.2(5/4):

The subtype defined by the subtype_indication, if any, of a generalized iterator
component iterator shall statically match the iteration cursor subtype.

Modify 5.5.2(7/3) by swapping the second and third sentences and making the other
changes indicated:

An iterator_specification declares a loop parameter. In {a generalized
iterator, }an array component iterator{,} or a container element iterator, if
a {loop_parameter_}subtype_indication is present, it determines the nominal
subtype of the loop parameter. In a generalized iterator, {if a
loop_parameter_subtype_indication is not present, }the nominal subtype of the
loop parameter is the iteration cursor subtype.  In an array component iterator,
if a {loop_parameter_}subtype_indication is not present, the nominal subtype of
the loop parameter is the component subtype of the type of the iterable_name. In
a container element iterator, if a {loop_parameter_}subtype_indication is not
present, the nominal subtype of the loop parameter is the default element
subtype for the type of the iterable_name.

Replace AARM 5.5.2(8.a/4) with:

     The loop parameter of a generalized iterator has the same accessibility
     as the loop statement. This means that the loop parameter object is
     finalized when the loop statement is left. (It also may be finalized as
     part of assigning a new value to the loop parameter.) For array component
     iterators, the loop parameter directly denotes an element of the array
     and has the accessibility of the associated array. For container element
     iterators, the loop parameter denotes the result of the indexing function
     call (in the case of a constant indexing) or a generalized reference
     thereof (in the case of a variable indexing). Roughly speaking,
     the loop parameter has the accessibility level of a single
     iteration of the loop. More precisely, the function result (or
     the generalized reference thereof) is considered to be renamed
     in the declarative part of a notional block statement which
     immediately encloses the loop's sequence_of_statements;
     the accessibility of the loop parameter is that of the
     block statement.

And add after 3.10.2(11.1/2) as another bulleted list item

   The accessibility level of an anonymous access type defined
   by an access_definition of a loop_parameter_subtype_indication
   is that of the loop parameter.

!discussion

For hole 1, we allow anonymous access types for consistency with other
kinds of object declaration (including extended return statements and generic
formal parameters), and with the syntax for component declarations. Whether
we should have done that for object declarations and component declarations
can be argued, but since we have, there should not be places where anonymous
access types cannot be written. Notice that static matching will always fail
for container element iterators, as the Iterator_Element has to be a "name",
and that does not include anonymous access types.

We've revised the accessibility rules to cover these anonymous access types.
We also revised the note describing the accessibility of loop parameters to
properly explain the container element iterator case, as the old description
seemed to require the nonsense of keeping the results of the indexing function
calls until the loop exited (as opposed to just the end of the iteration).


For hole 2, we allow an optional subtype_indication on a generalized
iterator. We don't want to force readers to look through many declarations
to find out the type of a loop parameter. We allow that type to be optional,
however, as it often is obvious from context. For instance, if one is
iterating a language-defined container, everyone should know that the
cursor type is named Cursor and it's defined in the instance that defines
the container type. But that's not true for user-defined iterators, which
may have been added to existing types for which the name "Cursor" is not
appropriate.

We don't need to allow an access_definition in a generalized iterator, as
the actual type provided to any generic instance (including an instance of
Ada.Iterator_Interfaces) is a subtype_mark; it cannot be an anonymous
access_definition. We use loop_parameter_subtype_indication anyway, just to
simplify the wording.


We could have allowed an optional subtype_indication in a traditional for
loop as well. But "in" here acts much like ":", so we don't really need
the extra subtype. And the static matching requirement would mean that
the same subtype would have to be written twice in most circumstances:
    for I : Short in Short loop
A charter member of the department of redundancy department. In addition,
it would have required additional wording and syntax changes in subclause
5.5. So this does not seem worthwhile.

!ASIS

No ASIS effect.

!ACATS test

An ACATS C-Test is needed to check that the new capabilities are supported.
