!summary

Something sensible happens with the pre- and postconditions when a requeue
occurs.

!question

Interactions between pre/post-condition checking (for entries) and requeues
appear to have some peculiar consequences.

Suppose entries E1 and E2 have pre- and post-conditions, a call to E1 requeues
to E2, and E2 returns normally.

Is E2's precondition ever checked? (A requeue isn't a call!) Is E1's
postcondition ever checked?

Is the answer to either of these questions a problem that needs to be
fixed? (Yes.)

!recommendation

(See Summary.)

!wording

** TBD.

!discussion

Let's assume that E1 and E2 are as defined in the question.

Entering any callable entity without evaluating its precondition is trouble,
as the body may assume that the precondition is true. (This is assuming that
the Assertion_Policy is Check, of course.) We need to ensure that E2's
precondition holds before its body executes, whether or not a requeue is
a call.

One expects the postcondition of E2 will be evaluated, but this is
problematical if that postcondition includes 'Old references that were never
evaluated on the original call.

We can use Legality Rules or dynamic checks to ensure these things are true
on a requeue. For a Legality Rule, we can use the existing conformance
mechanism -- we already do that for precondition inheritance. The advantage
of using Legality Rules is that they can be compatibly relaxed in the future;
changing runtime rules would be inconsistent.

!ASIS

No changes needed.

!ACATS test

An ACATS C-Test is needed to check that the handling of overlong encodings is
correct.

One reasonably substantive question followed by two corner case nits.

[Editor's note: Each question is handled separately.]

1) In internal discussions at AdaCore, it was noted that the
    interactions between pre/post-condition checking (for entries)
    and requeues appear to have some peculiar consequences.

    Suppose entries E1 and E2 have pre- and post-conditions,
    a call to E1 requeues to E2, and E2 returns normally.

    Is E2's precondition ever checked? (note that a requeue isn't a call)
    Is E1's postcondition ever checked?

    Is the answer to either of these questions a problem that
    needs to be fixed?

    [I don't think uses of 'Old in either of the two post-conditions
    add any problems, but it seems like a case to bear in mind
    when considering possible language changes in this area.]

I tend to think that the pre/post conditions should match between initial and
requeued entry, the same way as profiles must match, because the user shouldn't
even know that the service is provided through requeue. Matching conditions
could be (TBD) either the same, or weaker preconditions / stronger
post-conditions.

I understand that in practice, this means introducing a new conformance kind,
but it may be useful in other cases as well...

I agree, though weaker/stronger is not something the compiler should be expected
to determine, so these will require run-time checks or a very simple static
rule.  To keep things static, a simple rule would be no precondition or a
matching precondition on the target of the requeue (vaguely reminiscent of no
parameters or matching parameters). Similarly, the entry doing the requeue would
be required do have no postcondition or a postcondition that matched that of the
target entry.

E.g. a renaming-as-body could have used a similar rule.

I don't get it.  If E1 changes the state of the world, and then requeues to E2,
how can E2 be expected to have the same precondition? And if E1 has Post =>
F(X), then callers expect F(X) to be True upon return, but you're allowing E2 to
have no postcondition, so there's no run-time check that F(X) is True.

Sorry, I was both confused and confusing.  If E1 requeues on E2, then E1 must
check E2's precondition prior to the requeue, and E2 must have the same
postcondition as E1, or E1 must have no postcondition at all.

I don't see any new conformance kind here, or any new use of a similar rule.
We already use expression conformance in the renames-as-body case (6.1.1(17/3)),
and it's part of the homograph check in the requires overriding case
(6.1.1(13/3) and (16/3)). I would expect that we'd use expression conformance in
the same way if we wanted to enforce a similar rule. If we did find some reason
that the existing expression conformance was too limiting, I'm sure we'd change
it in such a way that it applied to all conformance (as we did for quantified
expressions).

The point being, we already do this in some cases, it certainly would make sense
to do it in more cases if that is necessary for those cases to make sense.

I think that requiring full conformance of postcondition expressions wouldn't
handle 'Old correctly (at least given the current definition of full
conformance).

Let's say the postcondition for both entries is
     X = X'Old + 1

Say E1 increments X and then requeues on E2; E2 increments X again, performs its
postcondition check (which passes), and returns normally.

The original caller is surprised to find that X has grown by 2, not 1.

One way to look at it is that the two uses of X'Old are names denoting two
different (implicitly declared) constants.

If we choose to view it that way, then it might make sense to (as you mentioned)
change the definition of expression conformance to handle this case.

I think this would be a compatible change because 'Old attribute references are
only allowed in postconditions and there are currently no language rules for
which the full conformance (or lack thereof) of a postcondition expression with
some other expression matters.

Do you mean that you are willing to accept that behaviour? I certainly wouldn't;
I'd prefer to completely remove postconditions on entries - better have no
contract than a contract you can't trust.

How to achieve correct behaviour is another matter. I can only think of either
passing all 'Old to the second entry, or evaluating the postcondition of the
first entry after the one of the second entry. Both seem unpleasant...

Interesting way to look at it.  But what happens if you requeue on yourself?

I suspect we will want to disallow requeue from an entry that uses 'Old in a
postcondition.

I think we should just say that X'Old doesn't conform, even with itself.
