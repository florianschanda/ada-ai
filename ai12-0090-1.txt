!subject Pre- and Postconditions and requeues

!summary

Something sensible happens with the pre- and postconditions when a requeue
occurs.

!question

Interactions between pre/post-condition checking (for entries) and requeues
appear to have some peculiar consequences.

Suppose entries E1 and E2 have pre- and post-conditions, a call to E1 requeues
to E2, and E2 returns normally.

Is E2's precondition ever checked? (A requeue isn't a call!) Is E1's
postcondition ever checked?

Is the answer to either of these questions a problem that needs to be
fixed? (Yes.)

!recommendation

(See Summary.)

!wording

Add after 9.5.4(5/3):

  For every [Redundant:specific or class-wide] postcondition expression P1
  that applies to the named entry E1, there shall be exist a postcondition
  expression P2 that applies to the entry E2 of the innermost
  enclosing callable construct such that
    - P1 is fully conformant with the the expression produced by
      replacing each reference in P2 to a formal parameter of E2
      with a reference to the corresponding formal paramter of E1; and
     - if P1 is enabled, then P2 is also enabled.

   AARM Note:
   Roughly speaking, the postcondition of the requeue target shall imply
   that of the enclosing callable construct.

   The named entry shall not have an applicable specific or class-wide
   postcondition[Redundant:, enabled or not,] which includes an Old
   attribute_reference.

   If the named entry is declared immediately with the task_definition of
   a named task type or the protected_definition of a named protected type,
   and if the requeue statement occurs within the body of that type, and
   if the requeue is an external requeue, then the named entry shall not
   have a specific or class-wide postcondition[Redundant:, enabled or not]
   which includes a name denoting either the current instance of that
   type or any entity declared within that type's declaration.

[Discussion: This introduces a case where replacing an anonyous
task/protected type with the "equivalent" type/object declaration pair
isn't equivalent - the latter version might violate this rule. If this is
viewed as a problem, the obvious solution is to also ban the construct
in the case of an anonymous type even though we don't really need to.

We do not attempt to prevent uses in postconditions of things like (instances
of) Ada.Task_Attributes or Ada.Task_Identification.Current even though
those might yield different results depending on the identity of the
task which evaluates the postcondition expression.

There is deliberately no mention of type invariants in the RM wording for
this AI. The idea is that requeues cannot be used to bypass postcondition
checks, but they can be used to bypass type invariant checks.]

Insert a new sentence in middle of 9.5.4(7/3):

   The execution of a requeue_statement proceeds by first evaluating the
   procedure_or_entry_name [Redundant:, including the prefix identifying the
   target task or protected object and the expression identifying the entry
   within an entry family, if any]. {Precondition checks are then
   performed as for a call to the named entry.}
   The entry_body or accept_statement enclosing the requeue_statement is
   then completed[Redundant:, finalized, and left (see 7.6.1)].

Modify 9.5.4(12/3):

   If the requeue target named in the requeue_statement has formal
   parameters, then during the execution of the accept_statement
   or entry_body corresponding to the new entry {and during the checking of
   any preconditions of the new entry}, the formal parameters denote the
   same objects as did the corresponding formal parameters of the
   callable construct completed by the requeue. [Redundant:In any case, no
   parameters are specified in a requeue_statement; any parameter
   passing is implicit.]

!discussion

Let's assume that E1 and E2 are as defined in the question.

Entering any callable entity without evaluating its precondition is trouble,
as the body may assume that the precondition is true. (This is assuming that
the Assertion_Policy is Check, of course.) We need to ensure that E2's
precondition holds before its body executes, whether or not a requeue is
a call.

One expects the postcondition of E2 will be evaluated, but this is
problematical if that postcondition includes 'Old references that were never
evaluated on the original call.

We can use Legality Rules or dynamic checks to ensure these things are true
on a requeue. For a Legality Rule, we can use the existing conformance
mechanism -- we already do that for precondition inheritance. The advantage
of using Legality Rules is that they can be compatibly relaxed in the future;
changing runtime rules would be inconsistent.

!ASIS

No changes needed.

!ACATS test

An ACATS C-Test is needed to check that the handling of overlong encodings is
correct.

One reasonably substantive question followed by two corner case nits.

[Editor's note: Each question is handled separately.]

1) In internal discussions at AdaCore, it was noted that the
    interactions between pre/post-condition checking (for entries)
    and requeues appear to have some peculiar consequences.

    Suppose entries E1 and E2 have pre- and post-conditions,
    a call to E1 requeues to E2, and E2 returns normally.

    Is E2's precondition ever checked? (note that a requeue isn't a call)
    Is E1's postcondition ever checked?

    Is the answer to either of these questions a problem that
    needs to be fixed?

    [I don't think uses of 'Old in either of the two post-conditions
    add any problems, but it seems like a case to bear in mind
    when considering possible language changes in this area.]

I tend to think that the pre/post conditions should match between initial and
requeued entry, the same way as profiles must match, because the user shouldn't
even know that the service is provided through requeue. Matching conditions
could be (TBD) either the same, or weaker preconditions / stronger
post-conditions.

I understand that in practice, this means introducing a new conformance kind,
but it may be useful in other cases as well...

I agree, though weaker/stronger is not something the compiler should be expected
to determine, so these will require run-time checks or a very simple static
rule.  To keep things static, a simple rule would be no precondition or a
matching precondition on the target of the requeue (vaguely reminiscent of no
parameters or matching parameters). Similarly, the entry doing the requeue would
be required do have no postcondition or a postcondition that matched that of the
target entry.

E.g. a renaming-as-body could have used a similar rule.

I don't get it.  If E1 changes the state of the world, and then requeues to E2,
how can E2 be expected to have the same precondition? And if E1 has Post =>
F(X), then callers expect F(X) to be True upon return, but you're allowing E2 to
have no postcondition, so there's no run-time check that F(X) is True.

Sorry, I was both confused and confusing.  If E1 requeues on E2, then E1 must
check E2's precondition prior to the requeue, and E2 must have the same
postcondition as E1, or E1 must have no postcondition at all.

I don't see any new conformance kind here, or any new use of a similar rule.
We already use expression conformance in the renames-as-body case (6.1.1(17/3)),
and it's part of the homograph check in the requires overriding case
(6.1.1(13/3) and (16/3)). I would expect that we'd use expression conformance in
the same way if we wanted to enforce a similar rule. If we did find some reason
that the existing expression conformance was too limiting, I'm sure we'd change
it in such a way that it applied to all conformance (as we did for quantified
expressions).

The point being, we already do this in some cases, it certainly would make sense
to do it in more cases if that is necessary for those cases to make sense.

I think that requiring full conformance of postcondition expressions wouldn't
handle 'Old correctly (at least given the current definition of full
conformance).

Let's say the postcondition for both entries is
     X = X'Old + 1

Say E1 increments X and then requeues on E2; E2 increments X again, performs its
postcondition check (which passes), and returns normally.

The original caller is surprised to find that X has grown by 2, not 1.

One way to look at it is that the two uses of X'Old are names denoting two
different (implicitly declared) constants.

If we choose to view it that way, then it might make sense to (as you mentioned)
change the definition of expression conformance to handle this case.

I think this would be a compatible change because 'Old attribute references are
only allowed in postconditions and there are currently no language rules for
which the full conformance (or lack thereof) of a postcondition expression with
some other expression matters.

Do you mean that you are willing to accept that behaviour? I certainly wouldn't;
I'd prefer to completely remove postconditions on entries - better have no
contract than a contract you can't trust.

How to achieve correct behaviour is another matter. I can only think of either
passing all 'Old to the second entry, or evaluating the postcondition of the
first entry after the one of the second entry. Both seem unpleasant...

Interesting way to look at it.  But what happens if you requeue on yourself?

I suspect we will want to disallow requeue from an entry that uses 'Old in a
postcondition.

I think we should just say that X'Old doesn't conform, even with itself.

Here are some comments from me on Steve's AI12-0090-1/02. Steve and I both
hoped that he's be able to deal with some or all of these before the deadline,
but that wasn't possible. So I'm sending these to the group to put them on
the record for when we discuss the AI this weekend.

---------

In the !wording section:

  Section 7.3.2 (Type Invariants) describes the criteria for determining
  whether type invariant checks associated with a given type T
  are performed upon successful return from a given subprogram subprogram
Dept. of redundancy dept.--------------------------------------^
  or entry. Such a subprogram or entry is said to be a boundary subprogram
  for the type T. The entry corresponding to the enclosing callable
  construct shall not be a boundary subprogram for any type T.

[Discussion: Keep it simple; we could try for some rules like with postconditions
saying that the same type invariant checks must be performed by the entry of the
enclosing callable entity and by the requeue target, but that seems unnecessarily
complicated.]

This isn't wording! You have to insert something into 7.3.2 to define "type
invariant boundary callable entity". (An entry is not a subprogram, so defining
it to be some sort of subprogram isn't going to fly.) And then you have to have
a rule in 9.5.4 somewhere using that definition.

Also, I think there needs to be a discussion of this problem in the !discussion
section. (In particular, how it could arise as described in the minutes.)

---

I'd also like some discussion of the problem that led to the last new paragraph
in 9.5.4(5/3). I have no idea why that's needed, and while I'm sure it's
important, we need to put why on the record somewhere.

---

I don't see how "named entry E1" (in the new text 9.5.4(5/3)) works if the
requeue is on a procedure implemented by an entry. This is *not* an entry. I
also think you need to work in "target" somehow. Because this doesn't say
what's naming the entry E1. All of the other nearby paragraphs say either
"target" or "requeue target". Maybe you could solve both issues by saying
"named target E1" so that it doesn't actually mention entry. (Otherwise,
"entry or subprogram" would needed.) (I'm assuming you want to say "named"
so that the rule applies nominally -- "named" here meaning about the same as
"statically denoted" and not at run-time (which of course would be impossible
because you don't know the preconditions of the actual entity if this is
dispatching call through an interface).

Better late than never. I got a little bit of extra time due to a flight delay

I was trying to confine the changes to 9.5.4, but we could certainly take the
approach you describe if folks feel that is more appropriate.
I agree that it would be cleaner if 7.3.2 defined the term that we want.

> I'd also like some discussion of the problem that led to the last new

Suppose we have a task or protected type T with an entry E and two objects,
X1 and X2, of that type. Suppose further that we requeue from X1.E to X2.E. If
the postcondition for E refers to the current instance of the type (or
something declared therein). Then the postconditions for X1.E and for X2.E are
not the same (in particular, the postcondition for X2.E does not imply the
postcondition for X1.E, which is the high-level goal of these postcondition
rules). Consider, for example, a postcondition expression involving T'Identity
or E'Count.

There may be a similar issues now that I think of it, with postconditions that
reference Task_Identification.Current_Task. Ugh.
