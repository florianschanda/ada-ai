!subject Missing rules for Discard_Names aspect

!summary

Discard_Names is an aspect, with typical rules.

!question

Discard_Names is not on the list of language-defined aspects and nothing in C.5 says
that it can be used as an aspect name, but AARM Note C.5(6.a/3) says it is a
language-defined aspect. Which is it? (It's an aspect.)

!recommendation

(See !summary.)

!wording

Change the title of C.5 to:

   Aspect and Pragma Discard_Names

Modify C.5(1):

Redundant[A pragma Discard_Names may be used to request a reduction in storage
used for the names of {muggywomp}[certain] entities. {*Muggywomp* entities are
those for which the name of the entity has a runtime effect.}]

[Editor's note: I couldn't find a good term, so "muggywomp" is a placeholder,
please help!]

Add after C.5(1):

Static Semantics

A muggywomp entity is a nonderived enumeration first subtype, a tagged first
subtype, or an exception.

For a muggywomp entity, the following language-defined representation aspect may
be specified:

Discard_Names
The type of aspect Discard_Names is Boolean. If directly specified, the aspect_definition
shall be a static expression. If not specified (including by inheritance), the aspect is
False.

[Also, make sure this aspect gets added to the index of aspects in K.1:
Discard_Names -- Reduces storage for names associated with an entity.]

Modify C.5(5):

The local_name (if present) shall denote a {muggywomp entity}[nonderived
enumeration first subtype, a tagged first subtype, or an exception]. The pragma
[applies to]{specifies that the aspect Discard_Names for} the type or exception
{has the value True}. Without a local_name, the pragma [applies to]{specifies
that} all {muggywomp}[such] entities declared after the pragma, within the same
declarative region{ have the value True for aspect Discard_Names}.
Alternatively, the pragma can be used as a configuration pragma. {If the
configuration pragma Discard_Names applies to a compilation unit, all muggywomp
entities declared in the compilation unit have the value True for the aspect
Discard_Names.} [If the pragma applies to a type, then it applies also to all
descendants of the type.]

[Editor's note: We don't need the last sentence because normal aspect inheritance applies and
has that effect.]

Modify C.5(7/2):

If the [pragma applies to]{aspect Discard_Names is True for} an enumeration
type, then the semantics of the Wide_Wide_Image and Wide_Wide_Value attributes
are implementation defined for that type; the semantics of Image, Wide_Image,
Value, and Wide_Value are still defined in terms of Wide_Wide_Image and
Wide_Wide_Value. In addition, the semantics of Text_IO.Enumeration_IO are
implementation defined. If the [pragma applies to]{aspect Discard_Names is True
for} a tagged type, then the semantics of the Tags.Wide_Wide_Expanded_Name
function are implementation defined for that type; the semantics of
Tags.Expanded_Name and Tags.Wide_Expanded_Name are still defined in terms of
Tags.Wide_Wide_Expanded_Name. If the [pragma applies to]{aspect Discard_Names is
True for} an exception, then the semantics of the
Exceptions.Wide_Wide_Exception_Name function are implementation defined for that
exception; the semantics of Exceptions.Exception_Name and
Exceptions.Wide_Exception_Name are still defined in terms of
Exceptions.Wide_Wide_Exception_Name.

Modify C.5(8):
If the [pragma applies to]{aspect Discard_Names is True for} an entity, then the
implementation should reduce the amount of storage used for storing names
associated with that entity.

!discussion

The original intent was that blanket rules in 13.1 and 13.1.1 would be sufficient
to specify the rules for aspect pragmas. But eventually every such pragma except
this one got explicit rules. It seems weird that this solitary pragma depends on
the blanket rules (enough that it failed to get added to the index of aspects).

In addition, it's not clear that the blanket rules define the type of the aspect and
any requirements on the expression.

Finally, if we add the aspect to the aspect index, it would be bad if there was no
text describing the aspect at the target of that index entry.

So, for all of these reasons, we define the aspect here, and then define the pragma
in terms of the aspect in the usual way.

In doing this, an old bug was discovered, in that a congifuration pragma is
defined to apply to a compilation unit, not the entities defined in that unit
(which is what we want here). That was corrected in these wording changes.

It is not the intent of these changes to change the effect of pragma
Discard_Names (as understood, as opposed to formally defined) in any way.

!ACATS Test

A test of aspect Discard_Names should be created (possibly an existing pragma test
could be used as a basis).

!ASIS

No ASIS effect.

AARM Note C.5(6.a/3) says:

Representation pragmas automatically specify aspects of the same name, so
Discard_Names can be used as an aspect_mark in an aspect_specification instead of
using the pragma on individual entities.

Unlike a lot of other pragmas, this one was not obsolesced because it can also act
as a configuration pragma (and there is no such thing as a configuration aspect -
what would it be an aspect of?). As such, the text of this subclause was unchanged
from Ada 2005.

However, I note that this aspect didn't make it into the list of language-defined
aspects, presumably because there is no text defining that it exists (unlike
virtually every other aspect).

I presume that its being omitted from the list of language-defineed aspects is an
oversight. However, it probably would be good to put some text in C.5 mentioning
that this aspect exists. Otherwise, someone coming from the list of aspects to C.5
is going to be mightly confused (the rule that makes it exist is in 13.1, after
all).

Thoughts? If there is agreement that this should be done, I'll propose some wording
and write up a ramification AI to do it. (It's a bit more than a pure presentation
change; I'd write it as a confirmation AI, but those don't allow any associated
wording changes.)

Here is an attempt at the wording for the Discard_Names AI [this is version
/02 - ED]; I need a nice term to use, however. Ideas welcome.
