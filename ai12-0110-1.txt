!summary

Any needed tampering checks are performed before any other language-defined
checks.

!question

What should happen when inserting into a full bounded container when tampering
is prohibited? Should it cause Capacity_Error because the container is full,
or Program_Error because it's tampering when tampering is prohibited? Or is
this unspecified? (Program_Error.)

!recommendation

(See Summary.)

!wording

Modify A.18.2(97.1/3):

When tampering with cursors is prohibited for a particular vector object V,
Program_Error is propagated by a call of any language-defined subprogram that
is defined to tamper with the cursors of V, leaving V unmodified. Similarly,
when tampering with elements is prohibited for a particular vector object V,
Program_Error is propagated by a call of any language-defined subprogram that
is defined to tamper with the elements of V Redundant[(or tamper with the
cursors of V)], leaving V unmodified. {These checks are made before any other
defined behavior of the body of the language-defined subprogram.}

AARM Ramification: The tampering check should be made before any other checks
or operations defined by the container operation.

Modify A.18.3(69.1/3), A.18.4(15.1/3), A.18.7(14.1/3), A.18.10(90/3), and
A.18.18(35/3) similarly.

!discussion

Generally, we have been careful to define the order of the checks for the
containers. In this case, there is no rule given.

Tampering occurs when one calls a subprogram that they're not allowed to
call in the current context. As such this check should be early in the
call, before more specific things happen.

For instance, consider inserting into a full bounded container when
tampering with cursors is prohibited. In this case, the insertion is
prohibited; the fact that the container is full is secondary. If the programmer
increased the size of the container to get rid of the Capacity_Error, they
shouldn't be greeted with a Program_Error from calling Insert in the wrong
place.

An alternative to this wording would be to adopt the Pre- and
Post-conditions proposed in AI12-0112-1. That seems like too much change for
a corrigendum, but could be the long-term solution to this issue.

Hi.  Has anyone any thoughts on what should happen when inserting into a
full bounded container when tampering is prohibited?  Should it cause
Capacity_Error because the container is full, or Program_Error because
it's tampering when tampering is prohibited?  Is there any precedent for
which exception has priority, or is it left as implementation dependent?

****************************************************************

A few thoughts.

A) This is an issue any time a routine is defined to raise an exception *and*
   could possibly be tampering. For instance, a call of Replace_Element for a
   vector could raise Constraint_Error (if Position = No_Element) or
   Program_Error (if Position isn't in Container) or Program_Error (if the call
   was when Container was in a tampering context). The first two cases have a
   defined order, the later does not. You could have a similar question whether
   this call raises Constraint_Error or Program_Error if Position = No_Element
   in a tampering context.

B) I think we tried to get an intended order of checking when the routines were
   defined. But we didn't include any of the "blanket rule" exceptions
   (tampering, capacity).

C) I'm not sure that it's clear whether the Constraint_Error and Program_Error
   cases defined for individual routines come before or after the capacity
   checks. If we decide to define this carefully, we need to be careful about
   that.

D) The question has an angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin feeling. Does anyone really
   care what happens when a call is bad for *two* different reasons, so long as
   at least one exception is raised? So I'm a bit dubious about spending effort
   on defining this.

E) I would hope that for Ada 2020 we'd define at least some of these checks in
   terms of Preconditions. That would automatically give an order to the checks.
   (We'd need a few additional queries like In_Tampering_Region and
   Does_Cursor_Belong_to_Container to do that.) I wouldn't want to define the
   order of exceptions such that we can't do that (which could happen if
   exceptions that don't make sense as preconditions end up getting checked
   before ones that do).

Probably we ought to discuss this, but maybe the conclusion will be to do
nothing.

I understand that there are cases where several exceptions may be raised, and
that in general it doesn't matter which one is actually raised.

But in the case of tampering, I think it's different. There are circumstances
where you are not allowed to call certain subprograms: if you do, you get
Program_Error. You don't even enter the subprogram to check anything else.

In particular, if you increase the capacity of a container, you would expect the
capacity_error to disappear, not to be changed to Program_Error!

I am in favor of doing nothing. The scenario where

a) we spend time discussing it

b) we spend time carefully defining which exception you get

c) we spend time generating wording for the RM

d) we spend time writing silly ACATS tests that make sure implementations give
   the "right" exception.

e) implementors spend time adjusting their implementations to do the required
   thing, quite likely introducing extra overhead for the normal case.

Is unattractive, given that the benefit to users is absolutely zero, or perhaps
given the caution in e) negative.

I thought we had got past worrying too much and ACATS testing marginal cases :-)

Amazing, JPR came up with an actual use argument :-)

Still, unconvincing, I bet this scenario never happens except in the ACATS tests
for the lifetime of the products.

BTW, we are seeing users quite unhappy with the tampering check overhead, and we
expect that many/most of our users will ignore the standard containers and use
our set of simplified "formal" containers, which were aimed at facilitating
proof, but are quite generally usable as light weight much more efficiency
routines.

My initial reaction was that the tampering check should come first.

Me second reaction was, I don't really care enough about this to discuss, change
the RM, etc.

I can live with the precedence of exceptions being undefined, I just need to

A problem with this is that the behaviour of the only current implementation
varies between containers.

THAT is highly undesirable, and I would argue it is a reason for requiring
something. Consistency between containers has always been a goal.

But what of what possible value is this consistency. After all it would be
patently absurd to say "it doesn't matter which exception you raise, but you
must raise the same one in every case". I must say I can't see spending one
minute of time working on this issue, no matter what the ARG says, we have so
many more pressing things to work on.

By the way, an ACATS test worrying about which exception is raised here is for
me a perfect example of returning to days when ACATS tests wasted far too much
time worrying about marginal cases of no possible interest to users.

At AdaCore, we may or may not bother to move forward our ACATS testing to the
new version of the ACATS tests. We have not made a decision on this, but for
sure we are less likely to bother making this step if the suite concentrates on
marginal issues such as this. Of course that does not mean we will ignore other
tests, we are always free to pick up whatever tests we find useful :-)

Actually I have spent more time by now reading this thread than adding a few
lines of code to some of the containers, so I’ll do that in the hope that the
ARG will focus on more pressing issues.

What I meant is that, as a user, if I write some code using one kind of
container, and then decide to switch to another but compatible container, I
would find it unfriendly if I have to change my code because the exception
raised in some circumstances is not consistent.

I don't see that as realistic, your code would have to be prepared to handle

Tampering, which is the one chosen in a majority of the containers already.

seems reasonable, most likely means that most programs would treat the situation
as fatal and not try to recover, which as JPR noted, leads to slightly nicer
behavior when the container is full (you don't get a bogus capacity error
masking the real error in your program).
