!subject Operations of class-wide types and formal abstract subprograms
!summary

The actual operation for a formal abstract subprogram can be the implicit
operation created for T'Class.

!question

AI05-0131-1 is intended to allow the same set of implicitly defined "primitive"
operations for class-wide types, whether they're imported via implicit
inheritance (using primitives of a formal derived type) or via explicit
specification (using formal subprograms).

However, the AARM notes 12.6(8.e-m/2) make it clear that this is not the
case for formal abstract subprograms.

8.e/2
Ramification: This means that the actual is either a primitive operation of the
controlling type, or an abstract formal subprogram. Also note that this prevents
the controlling type from being class-wide (with one exception explained below),
as only specific types have primitive operations (and a formal subprogram
eventually has to have an actual that is a primitive of some type).
This could happen in a case like:
8.f/2
generic
   type T(<>) is tagged private;
   with procedure Foo (Obj : in T) is abstract;
package P ...
8.g/2
package New_P is new P (Something'Class, Some_Proc);
8.h/2
The instantiation here is always illegal, because Some_Proc could never be a
primitive operation of Something'Class (there are no such operations).
That's good, because we want calls to Foo always to be dispatching calls.

8.i/2
Since it is possible for a formal tagged type to be instantiated with a
class-wide type, it is possible for the (real) controlling type to be class-wide
in one unusual case:
8.j/2
generic
   type NT(<>) is new T with private;
   -- Presume that T has the following primitive operation:
   -- with procedure Bar (Obj : in T);
package Gr ...
8.k/2
package body Gr is
   package New_P2 is new P (NT, Foo => Bar);
end Gr;
8.l/2
package New_Gr is new Gr (Something'Class);
8.m/2
The instantiation of New_P2 is legal, since Bar is a dispatching operation of
the actual type of the controlling type of the abstract formal subprogram Foo.
This is not a problem, since the rules given in 12.5.1 explain how this routine
dispatches even though its parameter is class-wide.

New_P (direct explicit import) is illegal (even if Some_Proc is a primitive of
type Something and an implicit routine is created), while New_P2 (explicitly
using an implicit import) is legal.

This seems wrong: why should we allow implicit import (with all of the compiler
complication associated) without allowing the matching explicit import? Should
this be changed? (Yes.)

!recommendation

(See Summary.)

!wording

Modify 12.6(8.5/3):

The actual subprogram for a formal_abstract_subprogram_declaration shall be
[a dispatching operation of the controlling type or of the actual type
corresponding to the controlling type]{:
   * a dispatching operation of the controlling type; or
   * if the controlling type is a formal type, and the actual type
     corresponding to that formal type is a specific type T,
     a dispatching operation of type T; or
   * if the controlling type is a formal type, and the actual type
     is a class-wide type T'Class, an implicitly declared subprogram
     corresponding to a primitive operation of type T (see Static
     Semantics below).}

Replace 12.6(8.e/2) by:

Ramification: This means that the actual is a primitive operation of the
controlling type, an abstract formal subprogram, or the implicitly available
primitive operation for a class-wide type.

An explicit class-wide operation cannot be used for the actual of an formal
abstract subprogram. Such an operation is never primitive (only specific
types have primitive subprograms).

This could happen in a case like:

Replace 12.6(8.h/2) by:
If Some_Proc is an explicit class-wide operation, the instantiation here is
illegal, because Some_Proc is not a primitive operation of Something'Class
(there are no such operations).

However, if Some_Proc is a primitive operation of type Something, then the
instantiation is legal; the actual is the implicitly generated subprogram
described in Static Semantics below. This is not a problem, since the rules
given in 12.5.1 explain how this routine dispatches even though its parameter
is class-wide.

Replace 12.6(8.i/2) by:
We allow this special case because it is possible for a class-wide operation
to be primitive inside of an instance, and the contract model does not allow
us to make such cases illegal. As such, it seems inconsistent to not allow
the same in explicit instantiations.

Specifically, since it is possible for a formal tagged type to be instantiated
with a class-wide type, it is possible for the (real) controlling type to
be class-wide in the following unusual case:

Replace 12.6(8.m/2) by:
The instantiation of New_P2 is legal, since Bar is a dispatching operation of
the actual type of the controlling type of the abstract formal subprogram Foo.
Again, the rules given in 12.5.1 explain how this routine dispatches.

!discussion

This is a rather unimportant case. It can't come up for the motivating case for
formal abstract subprograms -- Generic_Dispatching_Constructor -- because the
implicit declarations are not constructed for functions that only have
controlling results.

Still, consistency suggests that both cases should work the same. It's silly
to prohibit New_P when a legal similar example can be constructed with an extra
level of generic.

Note that we cannot make New_P2 or New_Gr illegal without breaking the contract
model (New_P2 is in a body, and the problem comes about because of the instance
New_Gr; other instances could quite clearly be legal and useful.) Thus the
only alternative to make this consistent is to allow it in the explicit case.

No ASIS effect.

I'm not sure that we considered the interaction (if any) between AI05-0131-1 and
formal abstract subprograms.

AI05-0131-1 added matching rules so that formal subprograms could resolve the
same implicit subprograms as exist for primitives of a formal type.
Specifically, 12.6(9.1-9.2/3):

If a subtype_mark in the profile of the formal_subprogram_declaration denotes a
formal private or formal derived type and the actual type for this formal type
is a class-wide type T'Class, then for the purposes of resolving the
corresponding actual subprogram at the point of the instantiation, certain
implicit declarations may be available as possible resolutions as follows:

  For each primitive subprogram of T that is directly visible at the point of
  the instantiation, and that has at least one controlling formal parameter, a
  corresponding implicitly declared subprogram with the same defining name, and
  having the same profile as the primitive subprogram except that T is
  systematically replaced by T'Class in the types of its profile, is potentially
  use-visible. The body of such a subprogram is as defined in 12.5.1 for
  primitive subprograms of a formal type when the actual type is class-wide.

As written, this clearly applies to formal_abstract_subprogram_declarations,
as those are one of the two kinds of formal subprograms.

Now consider 12.6(8.5/2) and its lengthy Ramification (with some annotation on
the annotations by me):

The actual subprogram for a formal_abstract_subprogram_declaration shall be a
dispatching operation of the controlling type or of the actual type
corresponding to the controlling type.

8.e/2
Ramification: This means that the actual is either a primitive operation of the
controlling type, or an abstract formal subprogram. Also note that this prevents
the controlling type from being class-wide (with one exception explained below),
as only specific types have primitive operations (and a formal subprogram
eventually has to have an actual that is a primitive of some type).

[Randy: This is clearly true. The implicit subprograms described above and in
12.5.1 for primitives are never described as "primitive".]

This could happen in a case like:
8.f/2
generic
   type T(<>) is tagged private;
   with procedure Foo (Obj : in T) is abstract;
package P ...
8.g/2
package New_P is new P (Something'Class, Some_Proc);
8.h/2
The instantiation here is always illegal, because Some_Proc could never be a
primitive operation of Something'Class (there are no such operations).

[Randy: Still true.]

That's good, because we want calls to Foo always to be dispatching calls.

[Randy: Not as obvious, see below.]

8.i/2
Since it is possible for a formal tagged type to be instantiated with a
class-wide type, it is possible for the (real) controlling type to be class-wide
in one unusual case:
8.j/2
generic
   type NT(<>) is new T with private;
   -- Presume that T has the following primitive operation:
   -- with procedure Bar (Obj : in T);
package Gr ...
8.k/2
package body Gr is
   package New_P2 is new P (NT, Foo => Bar); end Gr;
8.l/2
package New_Gr is new Gr (Something'Class);
8.m/2
The instantiation of New_P2 is legal, since Bar is a dispatching operation of
the actual type of the controlling type of the abstract formal subprogram Foo.
This is not a problem, since the rules given in 12.5.1 explain how this routine
dispatches even though its parameter is class-wide.

[Randy: Now we've stepped in it. See below.]

---- End of AARM quote.

According the AARM, it's OK to use a primitive of formal type that turns out to
be implicitly generated. So why are we preventing using an *explicit* reference
to an implicitly subprogram the same way? That was indeed the problem that we
were trying to fix with AI05-0131-1, but it seems that we left a corner of it.

That is, it seems that New_P (AARM 8.g/2) should be legal if New_P2 (AARM 8.l/2)
is legal when used in instance New_Gr. Note that we cannot make New_P2 or New_Gr
illegal without breaking the contract model (New_P2 is in a body, and the
problem comes about because of the instance New_Gr; other instances could quite
clearly be legal and useful.)

OTOH, this issue is so minor that we could (should?) put it on the "things we're
not going to fix" list (or, I suppose, ignore it completely). The issue does not
come up for the motivating use for formal abstract subprograms (generic
dispatching constructor), as functions without controlling parameters are not
included in the implicitly constructed subprograms. And it's unclear whether
anyone would expect the instantiation to work, especially as any call requires
the controlling operands to be dynamically tagged.

As has happened frequently recently, this has come up because I'm writing a test
to check that illegal instantiations are detected (that seems important for
instances of Generic_Dispatching_Constructor at a minimum). But how should I
test T'Class instances:

(1) Test it exactly as written in the RM. (That is, include a New_P test case
    which is marked illegal.)

(2) Put in a commented out test case like New_P, marked "pending ARG
    resolution". Possibly include a New_P-like example envolving a
    parameterless-function (which would be illegal under any interpretation).

(3) Ignore the class-wide cases altogether.

I don't like (3) as that would leave a permanent hole in testing for instances
of Generic_Dispatching_Constructor. It's easy to imagine someone using a
class-wide type by mistake or misunderstanding. That leaves (1) or (2); and that
choice comes down determined where this is (A) So insufficiently important that
we wouldn't ever plan to fix it [which leans toward (1)]; (B) Insufficiently
important to fix, but we'll put it on the list of things we're not going to fix
the wording for [which leans toward (2) - would not want the ACATS insisting on
semantics that we think is wrong]; or (C) fix when we get a round tuit [which
requires (2)].

P.S. GNAT seems to only implement 12.6(9.1-2/3) for operators, so it just
reports a profile mismatch. It does, however, think that class-wide types have
primitive operations. :-)

I would vote for (2), that is put a commented-out test that does a New_P-style
instantiation, and explain it is illegal in Ada2012, but might become legal in
some future version of the standard.  This would also give the GNAT folks a
chance to ponder the difficulty of supporting it relative to the expected
benefit.  They might find that it is *easier* to support it than to flag it as
illegal, if they are going to support the New_P2-style instantiation.  Or they
might decide it would add significantly to the complexity.

In either case, I would put the New_P2-style of instantiation in a separate
test, rather than making it an integral part of the one-and-only-test for 'Class
actuals.

Dunno; the two commas so close together look weird to me. Hopefully Mr.
Comma can comment. Gary, the original wording was:

The actual subprogram for a formal_abstract_subprogram_declaration shall be a
dispatching operation of the controlling type or of the actual type
corresponding to the controlling type{ or, if the actual type corresponding
to the controlling type is a class-wide type T'Class, an implicitly declared
subprogram corresponding to a primitive operation of type T (see Static
Semantics below)}.

[That is, no comma after the opening {.]

If I was going to change it, I probably would have moved the comma rather than
add one:

The actual subprogram for a formal_abstract_subprogram_declaration shall be a
dispatching operation of the controlling type or of the actual type
corresponding to the controlling type{, or if the actual type corresponding to
the controlling type is a class-wide type T'Class, an implicitly declared
subprogram corresponding to a primitive operation of type T (see Static
Semantics below)}.

Umm, no. :-) At least, the above doesn't make any sense to me.

Try:

The actual subprogram for a formal_abstract_subprogram_declaration shall be
 1) a dispatching operation
    a) of the controlling type
    or
    b) of the actual type corresponding to the controlling type.
 2) or if the actual type corresponding to the controlling type is a class-wide
    type T'Class, an implicitly declared subprogram corresponding to a primitive
    operation of type T (see Static Semantics below)}.

I suppose we could have used bullets (we tend to overuse them, but that seems
to happen because we get these weird rules with two ors at different levels):

The actual subprogram for a formal_abstract_subprogram_declaration shall be:
   * a dispatching operation of the controlling type or of the actual type
     corresponding to the controlling type; or
   * if the actual type corresponding to the controlling type is a class-wide
     type, an implicitly declared subprogram corresponding to a primitive
     operation of type T (see Static Semantics below)}.

We could even made it somewhat more symmetrical (and explain the T that shows up
unannounced at the end of the wording):

The actual subprogram for a formal_abstract_subprogram_declaration shall be:
   * a dispatching operation of the controlling type; or
   * if the actual type corresponding to the controlling type is a specific
     type T, a dispatching operation of type T; or
   * if the actual type corresponding to the controlling type is a class-wide
     type T'Class, an implicitly declared subprogram corresponding to a
     primitive operation of type T (see Static Semantics below)}.

Or even:

The actual subprogram for a formal_abstract_subprogram_declaration shall be:
   * a dispatching operation of the controlling type; or
   * if the controlling type is a formal type, and the actual type
     corresponding to that formal type is:
     o a specific type T, a dispatching operation of type T; or
     o a class-wide type T'Class, an implicitly declared subprogram
       corresponding to a primitive operation of type T (see Static
       Semantics below)}.

Wow. This wording can be refactored in so many ways!! I tend to prefer the
last two, with a slight preference for the last (most specific *and* fewer
words than the penultimate proposal).

What does everyone think?

If we change to one of the last two wordings, we probably ought to revote the
AI, but we could do that with a letter ballot (no need to reopen the whole
thing for a wording change that isn't intended to change the semantics).

Did we consider (I am eliminating the deleted part and the {} for clarity here):

    The actual subprogram for a formal_abstract_subprogram_declaration shall be:
      * a dispatching operation of the controlling type; or
      * if the controlling type is a formal type, and the actual type
        corresponding to that formal type is a specific type T,
        a dispatching operation of type T; or
      * if the controlling type is a formal type, and the actual type
        is a class-wide type T'Class, an implicitly declared subprogram
        corresponding to a primitive operation of type T (see Static
        Semantics below).

I can at least make more sense of this rephrased version.

I think that would remain true in the above suggested rephrasing.

We did; it was the penultimate version (of 6, I think). But of course "we"
was just Jeff and I, as no one else noticed the message. (I think it got
posted immediately before/during the AdaCore annual meeting and thus no
AdaCore people read it at all.)

I thought that version was rather wordy without adding any clarity, but of
course YMMV.

If people want to vote for the penultimate wording, that's fine by me. Just
don't split 6-6-1. :-)

I still prefer this slightly wordier version.  Note that I didn't repeat the
entire clause -- I omitted "corresponding to that formal type" in the third
phrase, but I think it is very clear what is meant.
