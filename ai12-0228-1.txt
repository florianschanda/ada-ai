!subject Properties of qualified expressions used as names
!summary

Properties of a qualified object pass through a qualified expression used
as a name. Specifically, "aliased" and "known to be constrained" are not
changed by a qualified expression.

!question

Consider the following:

    type Info is record
        Indent : aliased Natural;
        ...
    end record;

    ...

    function PI return Info;
    type Acc_Cnst_Nat is access constant Natural;
    Ptr_CNat : Acc_Cnst_Nat;

    Ren_Indent  : Natural renames PI.Indent;
    Ren_QIndent : Natural renames Natural'(PI.Indent);

    Ptr_CNat := Ren_Indent'Access; -- OK.
    Ptr_CNat := Ren_QIndent'Access; -- ????? (OK by this AI.)

The rename of Ren_QIndent is legal, as a qualified expression of an object is
an object (4.7(3.1/3)). However, Ren_QIndent'Access does not appear to be
legal, as the renames does not appear to be of an aliased view: a qualified
expression is none of the things in the list in the first sentence of
3.10(9/3).

Is this intended? (No.)

A similar issue exists for Known to be Constrained.

!recommendation

(See Summary.)

!wording

Add after 3.3(23.7/3):

* it is a qualified expression where the operand denotes a view of a
  composite object that is known to be constrained;

Modify 3.10(9/3):

A view of an object is defined to be aliased if it is defined by an
object_declaration, component_definition, parameter_specification, or
extended_return_object_declaration with the reserved word aliased, or by a
renaming of an aliased view. In addition, the dereference of an
access-to-object value denotes an aliased view, as does a view conversion (see
4.6) of an aliased view. {A qualified expression where the operand
denotes an aliased view is an aliased view.} The current instance of an
immutably limited type (see 7.5) is defined to be aliased. Finally, a formal
parameter or generic formal object of a tagged type is defined to be aliased.
[Aliased views are the ones that can be designated by an access value.]

!discussion

Note that this is similar to the way new kinds of objects are handled in
AI12-0226-1. We want type conversions, qualified expressions, and
parenthesized expressions to change the properties of an object as little as
possible.

An example of the problem with "Known to be constrained":

     TYPE R0 (D : INTEGER) IS
          RECORD
               F : INTEGER := D;
          END RECORD;
     TYPE REC (D : INTEGER := 1) IS
          RECORD
               F1 : INTEGER;
               F2 : R0(D); -- Discriminant-dependent component
          END RECORD;
     type Other_Rec is record
        F1 : Integer;
        F2 : R0(0);
     end record;
     function Func return Rec;
     function Func return Other_Rec;

     XX : R0 renames Func.F2; -- Ambiguous
     XY : R0 renames Rec'(Func).F2; -- ??? (OK by this AI.)
     XZ : R0 renames Other_Rec'(Func).F2; -- OK.

The declaration of XY is currently illegal, as Rec'(Func) is not something is
that is "Known to be constrained". Without the fix of this AI, you're out of
luck if you really need XY.

This is the sort of problem for which qualified expressions were changed to
names in the first place. It would make no sense to make compilers implement
a rather complicated change and then not allow it to work in some contexts.

!ASIS

No ASIS effect.

!ACATS test

ACATS tests should be created to check that both changes work. (Perhaps
additional cases added to existing tests.)

Consider the following:

    type Info is record
        Indent : aliased Natural;
        ...
    end record;

    ...

    PI : Info;
    type Acc_Cnst_Nat is access constant Natural;
    Ptr_CNat : Acc_Cnst_Nat;

    Ren_PI : Info renames PI;
    Ren_QPI : Info renames Info'(PI);
       -- This renames is legal as PI is an object, and a qualified expression of an object is an object.

    Ptr_CNat := Ren_PI.Indent'Access; -- OK.
    Ptr_CNat := Ren_QPI.Indent'Access; -- ??
    Ptr_CNat := Info'(PI).Indent'Access; -- ??

I think the second and third Access attributes are legal as 3.10(9/3) says:

A view of an object is defined to be aliased if it is defined by an
object_declaration, component_definition, parameter_specification, or
extended_return_object_declaration with the reserved word aliased, or by a
renaming of an aliased view. In addition, the dereference of an access-to-object
value denotes an aliased view, as does a view conversion (see 4.6) of an aliased
view. The current instance of an immutably limited type (see 7.5) is defined to
be aliased. Finally, a formal parameter or generic formal object of a tagged
type is defined to be aliased. [Aliased views are the ones that can be
designated by an access value.]

The component in both of these cases is "defined by a component_definition ...
with the reserved word aliased", so I think we're OK. [If you disagree tell me
ASAP since I have this in a new ACATS test.]

But now consider:

    Ren_Indent  : Natural renames PI.Indent;
    Ren_QIndent : Natural renames Natural'(PI.Indent);

    Ptr_CNat := Ren_Indent'Access; -- OK.
    Ptr_CNat := Ren_QIndent'Access; -- ?????

Here, the second access does not appear to be legal, as the renames does not
appear to be of an aliased view: a qualified expression is none of the things in
the list in the first sentence of 3.10(9/3).

Similarly:

    Ptr_CNat := Natural'(PI.Indent)'Access; -- ????

doesn't appear legal, either.

We may want to consider adding qualified expressions to the list of things that
can be aliased (with a rule like the one for renames), to be more consistent. It
might be helpful to qualify the prefix of 'Access since it can be overloaded (it
only works for access-to-constant, though), and it seems weird that it isn't
allowed there as it isn't aliased (even though objectness is passed through, and
aliased is passed through renames).

Presumably an oversight. Yes, a qualified expression ought to be/act as a
special case of view conversion, in this case a "view conversion" to the type
that it already has.

Agreed, so long as we remember that a qualified expression is a name that
denotes a constant view (even if the operand denotes a variable -- RM
4.7(3.1/3)), whereas a view conversion provides a variable view, if the operand
denotes a variable.

I was about to write a long-needed test for "known to be constrained" in object
renames. Of course, since I was thinking about qualified expressions earlier
this week, my first thought went there. So, taking part of an ancient test that
I was planning to upgrade:

     TYPE R0 (D : INTEGER) IS
          RECORD
               F : INTEGER := D;
          END RECORD;
     TYPE REC (D : INTEGER := 1) IS
          RECORD
               F1 : INTEGER;
               F2 : R0(D); -- Discriminant-dependent component
          END RECORD;

     RV1 : REC := ...;
     RC1 : CONSTANT REC := ...;

     X2  : R0 renames RV1.F2;   -- ERROR: R1 is not known to be constrained.
     X3  : R0 renames RC1.F2;   -- OK.

So, what about:

     XUgh : R0 renames REC'(RC1).F2; -- ???
     XXX  : R0 renames REC'(RV1).F2; -- Better be illegal.

Since qualified expressions aren't in the list for "known to be constrained",
both of the above have to be illegal (following the letter of the standard). But
of course that is silly, qualifying a "known to be constrained" thing shouldn't
wipe that property away (in either direction).

Erhard had suggested following the model of view conversions here. But view
conversions aren't included in "known to be constrained" at all. The AARM note
cryptically says that they "aren't relevant".

After some puzzlement, I realized that that is because view conversions are only
for tagged types (other than in the very limited context of actuals to "in out"
and "out" parameters). And all discriminated tagged types are indefinite or
immutably limited (mutable tagged types aren't allowed). Since "indefinite" and
"immutably limited" are the second and third bullets for "known to be
constrained", there are no other view conversions that need to be covered by
this rule. It would have been nice if this was explained somewhere (the AI just
repeats this AARM note).

[Aside: the fact that view conversions don't generally exist for untagged types
make them a lousy model for qualified expressions or anything else that can
happen generally for untagged types. End aside.]

Now for a brief diversion: The AARM note mentioned earlier says "the current
instance of a type" is one of the other cases that "aren't relevant". Again I
wondered why that is, and again the AI is no help. In this case, the reason is
that the current instance is a value in aspect specifications (like a type
invariant), so it can't be used in any "known to be constrained" contexts [in
particular, as the prefix of 'Access]. Inside of a type declaration, the current
instance can only be used in an immutably limited type, meaning it is already
covered. So I think we're OK. (I think Steve originally missed the type
invariant case; when he designed the "known to be constrained" wording, we
hadn't yet decided to insist that the current instance is a value.)

I have no idea why "objects of a formal discriminated private type" are
excluded; hopefully there is a good reason. End diversion.

Anyway, it looks like qualified expressions need to be handled here ("known to
be constrained"). If we do generally expand the definition of "object" further,
we need to consider any such changes here as well.

View conversion is an odd choice, since the whole point of a view conversion is
to preserve the writability of the operand, whereas a qualified expression
provides a constant view.

In any case, I see no need to add qualified expressions to the
known-to-be-constrained cases.  It just adds more complexity to something that
is already pretty subtle.

I think we should add them to the AARM list of things we do *not* permit in a
context requiring something that is known-to-be-constrained.

I think you answered this too fast. ;-)

The result of a function call is "known to be constrained". One can rename the
result of a function call. The reason that we made qualified expressions a name,
and had them pass through object-ness, is so that they can be used to
disambiguate function calls as needed.

Taken together, it seems to me that these facts require that "known to be
constrained" allow qualified expressions of items that are "known to be
constrained". Otherwise one gets nonsense.

     function Func return Rec;

     X98 : R0 renames Func.F2;  -- OK.
     X99 : R0 renames Rec'(Func).F2; -- Not OK???

If one imagines a case where Func is overloaded such that the qualification is
needed to remove an ambiguity, then one cannot make the rename legal (either it
is ambiguous or the component usage is illegal). That's silly, and defeats the
purpose of allowing qualified expressions to be names and objects in the first
place. (And it was some Tucker guy that wanted that, I think to eliminate this
sort of anomaly.)

As noted above, qualified expressions ARE relevant to the use of "known to be
constrained", so they don't make sense in the current note. Something on the
line of: "Similarly, qualified expressions are not known to be constrained,
because we're too lazy to add them even though they can matter in the intended
use of the term." :-)

Did you miss “constant” in the declaration for RC1 above? [Editor's note: The

True, but in a renaming, there is no ambiguity, since the context is so
explicit. Similarly, you need to know the target access type when using 'Access.
The reason *not* to do it is that it changes a variable into a constant view,
which I believe is bound to cause confusion when people use a qualified
expression on top of a variable, and then rename it or take 'Access.  It also
forces implementations to do more work in a context where disambiguation is
almost never needed.

Huh? Of course ambiguity is possible. If it wasn't, we'd never have needed to make a qualified expression a name in the first place, because qualifying the expression as a whole is enough to make the "context explicit".

There's never a requirement to qualify a variable; there IS a requirement in
some cases to qualify a function call.

> It also forces implementations to do more work in a context where

This I agree with, but then why did we make a qualified expression a name in the
first place? You can say exactly the same thing about it.

Lest you miss what I was talking about, imagine the following declarations:

     TYPE R0 (D : INTEGER) IS
          RECORD
               F : INTEGER := D;
          END RECORD;
     TYPE REC (D : INTEGER := 1) IS
          RECORD
               F1 : INTEGER;
               F2 : R0(D); -- Discriminant-dependent component
          END RECORD;
     type Other_Rec is record
        F1 : Integer;
        F2 : R0(0);
     end record;
     function Func return Rec;
     function Func return Other_Rec;

     XX : R0 renames Func.F2; -- Ambiguous
     XY : R0 renames Rec'(Func).F2; -- Illegal, not "known to be constrained" (according to Tucker)
     XZ : R0 renames Other_Rec'(Func).F2; -- OK.

If XY is really what you want, you're out of luck. And note that the context
here is no help.

But at least as concerning to me here is that you seem to not care that this
change is needed to make "known to be constrained" complete in this case. We
already have a variety of cases that probably would never happen outside of
ACATS tests included in "known to be constrained" (for instance, a "constant
return object in an extended return" -- who the heck is renaming that??), and it
seems bizarre to leave out a case that clearly is relevant just because it would
be a bit more work. Also remember that this rule also comes into play in other
cases than just renames/'Access: at least in iterators and generic actual in out
objects. It just doesn't make sense to leave any case out that can come up.

(Also: I think any discussion of qualifying variables is a red herring: outside
of ACATS tests, anyone qualifying variables is confused and it doesn't really
matter if they stay that way.)

It comes down to, if using a qualified expression as a name is important enough
to have in the language in the first place, then it needs to be as complete as
possible to minimize surprises.
