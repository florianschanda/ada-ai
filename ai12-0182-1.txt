!question

Protected operations (both entries and subprograms) do not appear to be
primitive operations of the protected type, as they don't meet any of the
qualifications of 3.2.3(2-7) [which defines primitive subprograms].
13.1.1(16/3) requires that an aspect ending with 'Class be given only
on tagged types or primitive subprograms of a tagged type.

Thus, Pre'Class is not allowed on a protected operation, regardless of
whether the protected type is tagged or whether the operation implements some
primitive subprogram of the type (inherited from a progenitor).

That poses a problem for protected operations, as Pre'Class is "or"ed with
any inherited Pre'Class, while Pre (which is legal) is effectively "and"ed.
A strict follower of LSP therefore cannot use Pre unless no Pre'Class is
inherited. Since a wrapper subprogram would not be allowed if the
Synchronization_Kind was By_Entry or By_Protected_Subprogram (as the
wrapper is neither of these things), we have a problem. Should Pre'Class
be allowed in these contexts? (Yes.)


!recommendation

(See Summary.)

!wording

Modify 13.1.1(16/3):

   If the aspect_mark includes 'Class, then the associated entity shall
   be a tagged type, a primitive subprogram of a tagged type, or an entry
   or protected subprogram that implements a primitive subprogram of a
   tagged type.

!discussion

Note that the same issues as described in the question apply to task entries;
the rules are written to cover those as well.

** Mostly TBD. -- See RLB mail of Feb 24th.

!ASIS

No ASIS effect.

!ACATS test

This rule should be tested with B-Tests and C-Tests; those are likely included
in the detailed objectives for 6.1.1 (which already have been created).

From: Randy Brukardt

I'm trying to figure out precisely where Pre'Class and Post'Class are legal,
so I can create tests to check that. (It also has a bearing on how important
various other objectives are; as if the only way to involve Pre'Class in a
protected operation is via inheritance, tests are less important than if
they can be directly specified as well.)

All of this discussion also applies to task entries, but I'll avoid mentioning
that for the most part to keep this simple(r).

I think I've concluded that protected operations (and task entries) do not allow
Pre'Class and Post'Class, but it's not crystal-clear. And I don't think it
matters for anything other than this rule, so I'm not sure that we ever really
answered the question.

The important rule is 13.1.1(16.3):

   If the aspect_mark includes 'Class, then the associated entity shall be a
   tagged type or a primitive subprogram of a tagged type.

Now, it's obvious that if the protected type is not tagged, then Pre'Class and
Post'Class are not allowed on any operation. So that's open and shut.

However, you can make a protected type tagged by including a progenitor. So that
alone doesn't fully answer the question.

I tried to apply the Dewar rule to see what we want, and that didn't help
either. On one hand, you can't derive from a protected type, so there is no use
for inheritance of Pre'Class and Post'Class. Post in particular will work just
fine in place of Post'Class. But (on the other hand), Pre is "and"ed with any
inherited Pre'Class, so Pre strengthens, not weakens, the precondition. If you
are strictly trying to follow LSP and you already have a Pre'Class, you can't
use Pre.

So that leaves figuring out what operations are primitive. At this point, I
think an example is needed:

   package Int is
      type Intf is synchronized interface;
      function Is_OK (Obj : Intf) return Boolean;
      procedure Proc (Obj : in out Intf)
         with Pre'Class => Is_OK (Obj);
      procedure Ent (Obj : in out Intf)
         with Pre'Class => Is_OK (Obj), Synchronization => By_Entry;
   end Int;

   with Int;
   package Pack is
       protected type Prot is new Intf with
          function Is_OK return Boolean;
          function Is_Wobbly return Boolean;
          procedure Proc;
          procedure Proc2;
          entry Ent;
          entry Ent2;
       private
          ...
       end Prot;
       -- function Is_OK (Obj : Prot) return Boolean; -- Inherited here.
       -- procedure Proc (Obj : in out Prot); -- Inherited here.
       -- procedure Ent (Obj : in out Prot); -- Inherited here.
   end Pack;

So, first of all, are any of the operations in Prot "primitive subprograms of a
tagged type"? Clearly, they're all operations of a tagged type (since Prot is
tagged), so that part is handled. What about the primitive subprogram part?

3.2.3 gives the definition of primitive subprograms as:

2 The primitive subprograms of a specific type are defined as follows:

3 The predefined operators of the type (see 4.5);

4 For a derived type, the inherited (see 3.4) user-defined subprograms;

5 For an enumeration type, the enumeration literals (which are considered
  parameterless functions - see 3.5.1);

6 For a specific type declared immediately within a package_specification, any
  subprograms (in addition to the enumeration literals) that are explicitly
  declared immediately within the same package_specification and that operate on
  the type;

6.1/3 For a specific type with an explicitly declared primitive "=" operator
  whose result type is Boolean, the corresponding "/=" operator (see 6.6);

7/2 For a nonformal type, any subprograms not covered above [that are explicitly
  declared immediately within the same declarative region as the type] and
  that override (see 8.3) other implicitly declared primitive subprograms of
  the type.

------

We're not interested in operators right now, so paras 3 and 6.1 don't apply, and
this surely isn't an enumeration type, so paragraph 5 does not apply. Paragraph
4 applies to the 3 subprograms that I showed commented out, but certainly not to
any of the operations declared inside of Prot. Similarly, paragraph 6 doesn't
apply (as the protected operations are not declared immediately within the same
package specification; they're inside of the protected type instead). Note that
it *could* apply to a subprogram declared after the commented out procedure Ent,
but that's obvious and the same as any other type so let's not consider that
further.

That just leaves us with paragraph 7. Clearly, it cannot apply to Is_Wobbly,
Proc2, and Ent2 (there is no implicitly declared primitive subprogram that
corresponds to those).

It seems pretty clear that paragraph 7 doesn't apply to the others, either. It
specifically uses "override", and none of these operations override anything;
rather they are "implemented by" the corresponding protected operations. (I
forget why we used that model, but we did so very intentionally -- I presume
there were some ramifications of overriding that were inappropriate for
"implemented by" operations.

Therefore, none of the protected operations Is_OK, Proc, nor Ent are primitive
for the tagged type Prot, and thus none of these operations allow Pre'Class or
Post'Class.

Question 1: Do you agree? Did I get this analysis right?

Question 2: Is this really what we want?

In particular, we can't weaken the precondition of Proc. (Proc has an inherited
precondition of Is_OK (Obj) from the interface.) For example, let's say that we
wanted to eliminate the precondition on Proc. That can't be done (directly):

    procedure Proc with Pre'Class => True; -- Is illegal by the above analysis

    procedure Proc with Pre => True; -- Has no effect, the effective precondition is "Is_OK (Self) and True"

One could do it by having Is_OK always return True, but that might not be
appropriate for some other reason.

Of course, I'm assuming that weakening a precondition is actually useful --
that's a premise I doubt in actual fact -- so I don't know if this really
matters. In the absence of weakening as being useful, Pre and Post work fine,
since no inheritance is possible anyway (since derivation is illegal).

In addition, adding an explicit subprogram declaration at the end of the visible
part of the package would indeed allow the use of Pre'Class:
    procedure Proc (Obj : in out Prot) with Pre'Class => True;
then renaming the protected operation Proc to Local_Proc and writing a body of:
    procedure Proc (Obj : in out Prot) is
    begin
       Obj.Local_Proc;
    end Proc;
This is really what "implemented by" does anyway, so it's only slightly annoying
to write this out. Note that Local_Proc is no longer inheriting a precondition,
so we've solved the problem (if there is one).

Thus my answers to my own questions are (1) of course!; and (2) dunno, but let's
leave it illegal until we hear screaming from actual users. (After all, changing
illegal to legal is almost always a compatible change; going in the other
direction isn't possible, in general.)

I guess I'd like some confirmation before putting in a bunch of hours to write
tests for these cases.

What say others here? (Or have I put you all to sleep?? ;-)

Well, that's exactly what the text says...

Not even talking about pre/post, it is possible to dispatch to such operations.
According to your analysis, it is therefore possible to dispatch to
non-primitive operations. Ouch! Something has to be done...

I'm unsure if that really matters; it might mess up the 20,000 foot view of Ada
a bit, but I doubt that 99% of users would care. And it clearly was intended
that "implemented by" is different than "overriding". I think the model of
"implemented by" is that there is a compiler-generated primitive operation that
calls the non-primitive operation, which certainly isn't unusual (there's no
reason that any primitive operation can't call something non-primitive - it
happens all the time).

So I think the issue is exclusively with Pre/Post (as inheritance is not
allowed).

No, I think we want to allow Pre'Class and Post'Class on any protected operation
that implements a primitive operation.

But that doesn't work for operations that have a "Synchronized => By_Entry" or
"Synchronized => By_Protected_Procedure" since they cannot be implemented by a
hand-written wrapper.

I would say we should allow 'Class aspects on any protected operation that
implements a tagged primitive.

Good point. But...

I didn't get this analysis quite right. There is in fact an implicitly declared
subprogram that overrides for "implemented by". But that clearly is a
*different* subprogram than the original operation; so the current rules allow
Pre'Class on the implicit subprogram but not on the original protected
operation.

The interesting thing is that this implicitly declared subprogram wouldn't be
allowed explicitly (as Tuck points out), and that's downright weird, as the
semantics (other than the one Legality Rule) are defined completely in terms of
an implicit subprogram that you're not allowed to write explicitly. There would
clearly be no harm in allowing some explicit subprograms within limits -- but
clearly that isn't important enough to mess with.

...

Sigh. We always chose the hardest path that makes it impossible to cross off
items on my work lists. :-)

I presume that the same ought to be true for a task entry that implements a
tagged primitive.

So you are suggesting that we change 13.1.1(16/3) to something like:

If the aspect_mark includes 'Class, then the associated entity shall be a tagged
type, a primitive subprogram of a tagged type, or an entry or protected
subprogram that implements a primitive subprogram of a tagged type.

Right?

I take it I get to write up an AI to this effect??

I've tried doing this (it will be AI12-0182-1; I mostly wanted the number so I could put it into my ACATS tests and documents), and in a case of what Steve calls "heat vision", I've got more questions than answers. :-)

(1) Are we sure that we want the suggested rule? Consider the original example with some additional preconditions:

   package Int is
      type Intf is synchronized interface;
      function Is_OK (Obj : Intf) return Boolean;
      procedure Proc (Obj : in out Intf)
         with Pre'Class => Is_OK (Obj);
      procedure Ent (Obj : in out Intf)
         with Pre'Class => Is_OK (Obj), Synchronization => By_Entry;
   end Int;

   with Int;
   package Pack2 is
       protected type Prot2 is new Intf with
          function Is_OK return Boolean;
          function Is_Wobbly return Boolean;
          procedure Proc
             with Pre'Class => Is_OK (Prot2); -- (1)
          procedure Proc2
             with Pre'Class => Is_OK (Prot2); -- (2)
          entry Ent
             with Pre'Class => Is_OK (Prot2); -- (3)
          entry Ent2
             with Pre'Class => Is_OK (Prot2); -- (4)
       private
          ...
       end Prot2;
       -- function Is_OK (Obj : Prot2) return Boolean; -- Inherited here.
       -- procedure Proc (Obj : in out Prot2); -- Inherited here.
       -- procedure Ent (Obj : in out Prot2); -- Inherited here.
   end Pack2;

With Tucker's originally proposed rule (as worded by me), aspects (1) and (3)
are legal, but aspects (2) and (4) are illegal. While this can be explained, I'd
say that the usability of this is suspect. One has to look up the definition of
the interface type(s) to be able to determine whether Pre'Class/Post'Class are
legal. I know I would rather have an all-or-nothing rule for that, rather than
having niggle with declaration details.

So, I suggest that we consider an alternative replacement for 13.1.1(16/3):

   If the aspect_mark includes 'Class, then the associated entity shall
   be a tagged type, a primitive subprogram of a tagged type, or a visible
   entry or visible protected subprogram of a tagged synchronized type.

This allows all of (1)-(4), but disallows 'Class on private/body operations of
the protected type.

But all is not yet well...

(2) The interaction of either of these rules with the (im)famous 6.1.1(7/4) --
the "nominal generic formal type" rule seems problematical (but not fatal).

Consider another version of the original example:

   with Int;
   package Pack3 is
       protected type Prot3 is new Intf with
          function Is_OK return Boolean;
          function Is_Wobbly return Boolean;
          procedure Proc
             with Pre'Class => Is_Wobbly (Prot3); -- (1)
          procedure Proc2
             with Pre'Class => Is_Wobbly (Prot3); -- (2)
          entry Ent
             with Pre'Class => Is_Wobbly (Prot3); -- (3)
          entry Ent2
             with Pre'Class => Is_Wobbly (Prot3); -- (4)
       private
          ...
       end Prot3;
       -- function Is_OK (Obj : Prot3) return Boolean; -- Inherited here.
       -- procedure Proc (Obj : in out Prot3); -- Inherited here.
       -- procedure Ent (Obj : in out Prot3); -- Inherited here.
   end Pack3;

All four of (1) .. (4) are illegal by 6.1.1(7/4) -- because the "nominal generic
formal type" only has access to primitive and class-wide subprograms of the
ancestor type, and Is_Wobbly is not primitive (as discussed by the original
version of this question).

In the previous Prot2 example, Is_OK does pass 6.1.1(7/4), as is it is an
inherited primitive operation of Intf. So this is a weird restriction on the
contents of Pre'Class (and Post'Class).

The good news is that this isn't fatal, in that one can always create a dummy
interface to use a progentitor to make any helper functions that aren't
otherwise primitive into primitive functions:

   with Int;
   package Pack4 is
       type Dummy_Intf is limited interface;
       function Is_Wobbly (Obj : Dummy_Intf) return Boolean;

       protected type Prot4 is new Intf and Dummy_Intf with
          function Is_OK return Boolean;
          function Is_Wobbly return Boolean;
          procedure Proc
             with Pre'Class => Is_Wobbly (Prot4); -- (1)
          procedure Proc2
             with Pre'Class => Is_Wobbly (Prot4); -- (2)
          entry Ent
             with Pre'Class => Is_Wobbly (Prot4); -- (3)
          entry Ent2
             with Pre'Class => Is_Wobbly (Prot4); -- (4)
       private
          ...
       end Prot4;
       -- function Is_OK (Obj : Prot4) return Boolean; -- Inherited here.
       -- function Is_Wobbly (Obj : Prot4) return Boolean; -- Inherited here.
       -- procedure Proc (Obj : in out Prot4); -- Inherited here.
       -- procedure Ent (Obj : in out Prot4); -- Inherited here.
   end Pack4;

Of course, this isn't very usable, but perhaps this situation will not come up
often??

I'm not much interested in revisiting the rabbit hole that 6.1.1(7/4) was,
especially as it is correct in the majority of the cases -- but perhaps we have
to?? [I note that we already have in a sense in AI12-0170-1, but for that we're
mostly confirming the obvious.]

Thoughts??
