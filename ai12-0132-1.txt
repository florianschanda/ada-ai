!question

AI12-0103-1 appeals to an analogy with renames-as-body in order to determine
how freezing for expression functions should work.

Unfortunately, a example using renames-as-body has a similar problem
as the one described in AI12-0103-1 for expression functions:

   package Pack is
      type Flub is range 0 .. 100;
      function Foo (A : in Natural) return Natural;
      function Bar (A : in Natural) return Natural is
         (A + Flub'Size); -- (A)
      type Fum is access function Foo (A : in Natural) return Natural;
      P : Fum := Foo'Access; -- (B)
      function Foo (A : in Natural) return Natural renames Bar; -- (C)
      Val : Natural := P.all(5); -- (D)
   end Pack;

(A) doesn't freeze anything. (B) does not trigger 13.14(10.1/3), since
Foo is not an expression function. (C) doesn't appear to freeze anything.
Finally, the call at (D) is legal and passes elaboration checks, but the
value of the result depends on a representation aspect of the unfrozen
type Flub.

This hole needs to be plugged somehow, right? (Yes.)

!wording

Add to the end of 13.14(10.3/3):

If the name of a renames-as-body denotes an expression function, the
expression of the expression function causes freezing.

!discussion

There isn't any rule in Ada 2012 that causes the freezing of the name of a
renamed entity.

It may be that we didn't worry about freezing these in Ada 95 and Ada 2005
because any problems would be detected by a failed elaboration check. For
instance, an Ada 95 example like the above could have been:

   package Pack2 is
      type Flub is range 0 .. 100;
      function Foo (A : in Natural) return Natural;
      function Bar (A : in Natural) return Natural; -- (A)
      type Fum is access function Foo (A : in Natural) return Natural;
      P : Fum := Foo'Access; -- (B)
      function Foo (A : in Natural) return Natural renames Bar; -- (C)
      Val : Natural := P.all(5); -- (D)
   end Pack2;

In this case, nothing freezes Bar, but the call at (D) will raise
Program_Error, so there will not be any possibility of evaluating something
unfrozen (like Flub). If Bar had been an instance, it would have frozen
everything before it.

Thus, it appears that this bug is also related to the introduction of
expression functions (for which neither the elaboration check nor freezing
work).

---

The proposed solution applies only to expression functions, as any other
solution would potentially be incompatible. The author does wonder if there
is any issue with the convention of the renamed subprogram being changed
after the renaming, but he doesn't have the mental energy to try to work
that out. :-)

In the example in the question, the proposed rule means that (C) causes the
expression of (A) to freeze. Then the call at (D) is safe because Flub has
been frozen.

!ASIS

No ASIS effect.

!ACATS test

Create an ACATS B-test to check that the case in the question causes a freezing
error.

I've just finished doing homework update to AI12-0103-1. But I'm a bit dubious
about the (near) equivalence between renames-as-body and
expression-function-as-completion because I can't quite figure out how
renames-as-body is supposed to work.

The problematical example (thanks, Steve!) for expression-function-as-completion
was:

   package Pack is
      type Flub is range 0 .. 100;
      function Foo (A : in Natural) return Natural;
      type Bar is access function Foo (A : in Natural) return Natural;
      P : Bar := Foo'Access; -- (A)
      function Foo (A : in Natural) return Natural is
         (A + Flub'Size); -- (B)
      Val : Natural := P.all(5); -- (C)
   end Pack;

This is fixed by making (B) freezing of the expression of the expression
function.

This appears to be essentially the same as a renames-as-body, as the renamed
entity ought to be frozen at that point. Except that I can't find any rule in
13.14 that would have that effect. "Renames" is never mentioned anywhere except
in 13.14(3/3) [which says it doesn't freeze]. The "name" freezing rule of
13.14(11) would do the trick, except that it requires something to freeze the
"name" first -- which is what I can't find.

If a renames-as-body *doesn't* freeze the renamed "name", we have the same
problem as shown above:

   package Pack is
      type Flub is range 0 .. 100;
      function Foo (A : in Natural) return Natural;
      function Bar (A : in Natural) return Natural is
         (A + Flub'Size); -- (A)
      type Fum is access function Foo (A : in Natural) return Natural;
      P : Fum := Foo'Access; -- (B)
      function Foo (A : in Natural) return Natural renames Bar; -- (C)
      Val : Natural := P.all(5); -- (D)
   end Pack;

The call at (D) is legal and passes elaboration checks, but the value of the
result depends on a representation aspect of the unfrozen type Flub.

The rules we introduced in AI12-0103-1 don't fix this hole, nor does
13.14(10.1-3/3).  If (C) froze Bar, then one would expect the expression to be
frozen, too (but unfortunately, that doesn't happen with the current rules -
only prefixes of 'Access and calls and uses in generic instances cause that
expression to freeze, and this is none of those.)

Perhaps this is a new problem introduced by the addition of expression functions
(any Ada 95 case would seem to raise Program_Error or already have been frozen),
but even that seems weird (we don't want freezing rules to depend on the
compiler's knowledge that an elaboration check will necessarily fail). If (A) is
just a normal specification (with a completion in a body somewhere), I don't see
any rule that would freeze it or the renames-as-body for the call (D).

So, have I missed something or is there a hole here? And is the hole old (just
wider now) or new? Is there any important value to not freezing the subprogram
involved in a renames-as-body?

P.S. Gosh, I hate freezing rules. It doesn't get the animosity it deserves since
we have accessibility and coextensions to take the heat instead. (And
admittedly, those are a lot worse.)
