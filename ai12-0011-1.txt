!subject Behavior of Random.Reset with default initialized State

!summary

** TBD.

!question

The packages Ada.Numerics.Float_Random and Ada.Numerics.Discrete_Random have the
following procedures;

procedure Save (Gen : in Generator;
                To_State : out State);

and

procedure Reset (Gen : in Generator;
                 From_State : in State);

The intent is that one must call Save first to save the State of the random number
generator, and then one can restore the state using the Reset call.

What happens if Reset is called, without having previously called Save, to save the state?
That is, if From_State is default initialized?

The packages Ada.Numerics.Float_Random and Ada.Numerics.Discrete_Random have the following procedures;

*procedure* Save (Gen : *in* Generator;
                               To_State : *out* State);

and

*procedure* Reset (Gen : *in* Generator;
                                From_State : *in* State);

The intent is that one must call Save first to save the State of the random number generate, and the one
can restore the state using the Reset call.

What happens if Reset is called, without having previously called Save, to save the state. ie. From_State
is default initialized? The RM does not specify the behaviour. Would this be equivalent to the time-dependent
Reset procedure? Does an exception get raised? Should this be specified?
