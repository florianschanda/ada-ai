!question

13.11.3(5/3) defines the aspect Default_Storage_Pool that can be used on an
instance to specify (or override) the default pool used in that instance.

We're wondering about the effect of that aspect on language-defined generic
units. For instance, it would be useful in some circumstances to use some
user-defined pool to do allocations in one of the containers, such as
Ada.Containers.Vectors. Is this expected to work? (???) What happens
if the pool is does something that the instance isn't expecting, like
deallocating memory early? (???)

!recommendation

(See Summary.)

!wording

** TBD (some options mentioned in the discussion)

!discussion

Changing the default pool could cause issues for a language-defined package
that was not expecting such a change. If the pool didn't support some feature
that the language-defined package was expecting, the package might fail to
operate as expected.

Similarly, many pools allow deallocation of memory via techniques other than
the standard language-defined ones; deallocating memory that a language-defined
package is still using would almost certainly crash the partition. Note that
the usual bailout (13.11.2(16/3)) will not work in this case, as the evaluation
of the name is hidden in the body of the language-defined package -- which
may not even be written in Ada.

While 13.11(21) declares a malfunctioning Allocate routine erroneous, there
are no such rules for any of the other routines in a Storage_Pool. Any unexpected
behavior could cause a language-defined package to malfunction.

Note that the use of the default pool by language defined generics varies from
never (Generic_Elementary_Functions) to unlikely (Bounded containers) to
maybe (Discrete_Random), to likely (Direct_IO, for file management)
to certain (Indefinite containers). Whether we want blanket rules for all or
just for the units that are likely to use the standard pool needs to be decided.

Currently, there is no requirement on how language-defined units are
implemented. As such, they might use no allocators at all, or use a custom
pool (for group deallocations, perhaps), or use the default pool. This would
be portability problem if users start expecting specifying the pool on an
instance of a language-defined package to have an effect.

We need to have some rules that apply to the use of aspect Default_Storage_Pool
on a language-defined generic, so that users know what is and is not expected
to work.

The easiest rule would be to simply disallow the use of aspect
Default_Storage_Pool on language-defined packages. If we're not prepared to
decide what this means, it may be best to not allow it at all. Then, in the
future, we could decide on a meaning unencumbered by existing uses.

Nearly as easy is to declare that any instantiation of a language-defined unit
with aspect Default_Storage_Pool is erroneous. The only downside to this is
that it would allow users that don't care or don't understand erroneousness to
ignore that and do it anyway. That could be a portability problem, but at least
it would be one clearly noted in the Standard.

No matter what we do, we could also except Pure packages from any rule, since
they shouldn't have any state, and thus no allocators, anyway.

We could try to be more specific about what causes problems:

For an instance of a language-defined generic unit that has aspect
Default_Storage_Pool specified:
   * Execution is erronous if the requirements of 13.11 for Allocate
     are violated for any call to Allocate for the specified pool.
   AARM Discussion: We're talking specifically about the definition of erronous
   execution when a pool is used with an access type; the same rules
   apply to such a standard package.
   AARM Ramification: If any memory is deallocated while the instance of the
   language-defined unit is still using it, execution is erroneous.

We'd probably want to say something about the operations in a pool that
supports subpools. Indeed, this seems to be missing from 13.11.4; there
should at a minimum be wording that says that execution is erroneous
if the address returned from Allocate_From_Subpool does not meet the
requirements for the address returned from Allocate described in 13.11.
If we added such wording to 13.11.4, then a minor change is needed above:

   * Execution is erronous if the requirements of 13.11 for Allocate
     or the requirements of 13.11.4 for Allocate_From_Subpool are
     violated for any call to Allocate for the specified pool.

I'm not sure if we need any protection against any of the other routines
malfunctioning. For a regular pool, the existing rule is enough as
Deallocate problems would necessarily cause the Allocate to fail to meet
its requirements, and Storage_Size doesn't have any critical meaning anyway.
That's not so clear for pools that support subpools, as a malfunctioning
Create_Subpool or Default_Subpool_for_Pool could have serious effects.


We could also try to make it work for language-defined units. That would look
something like:

Implementation Requirements

If a language-defined generic unit declares an access type which is used to
allocate memory, it shall use the default pool.

AARM Reason: This allows using aspect Default_Storage_Pool to force allocations
to use a specified pool. Note that we don't make any requirements on the
size or number of allocations from the default pool, so any pool specified
as the Default_Storage_Pool for an instance of a language-defined package
ought to support any reasonable allocations.

We would still need erroneous execution wording like that above.

This isn't going to allow anything useful for pools supporting subpools;
that would require adding subpool parameters somewhere in the definition
of the package -- at the point we've lost all transparency.

Also note that en-mass deallocations only could be safe after the instance
has been destroyed (gone out of scope); we would not want to put any
additional requirements on how language-defined packages manage memory.
(In particular, we wouldn't want to prevent the use of memory caches
in the containers, which could prevent repeated allocate/deallocate
cycles in some uses.)


Note that making it work only matters to generic packages; we don't have a
mechanism to change the default pool for normal packages.


We also could just make some generic packages work (the unbounded and
indefinite containers, which seem most useful) and leave the others
unspecified. That may make more sense, since the handling of files
(for instance) may or may not be able to work in a user-defined pool,
and it may not matter anyway as many of the I/O packages aren't generic.

For any packages that we're not requiring to work, we need at a minimum
some sort of erroneous execution wording, and probably a note to say that
changing the default pool may or may not have any effect; doing that is
not going to be usefully portable.


This is probably enough musings on this topic; we need to decide what we want
before continuing here.

!ASIS

No ASIS effect.

!ACATS test

Erroneous execution can't be tested. (If we require some units to do something
useful, we could make ACATS C-Tests to test that.)

I have been thinking more on this AI lately.
As we last left this, the idea was to extend the Default_Storage_Pool pragma to
allow 'Standard' be used to represent the allocation method used by the
implementation.

I think we are still missing some important capabilities here and I think we may
still want to consider providing an object declared in some package that can be
referenced, possibly in addition to the pragma.

I have been working lately with the C++ STL containers on an embedded project,
and noted that their templates provide an optional argument that may be
specified during the template (generic) instantiation, to replace the std
allocator.

It strikes me that this capability would be useful also for the Ada containers.
There currently does not appear to be a way to override the storage pool used by
the standard containers.

I think probably the way to add this capability would be to add a defaulted
generic formal parameter to the containers, where the default identifies the
implementations default allocator. In this way, the change could be introduced
in a manner that I believe would be backwards compatible to existing container
implementations.

Since storage pools are limited types, I think the way to do this would be to
use an access type, which defaults to the standard pool.

eg. something like;

generic
    type Index_Type is range <>;
    type Element_Type is private;

    with function "=" (Left, Right : Element_Type) return Boolean is <>;

    Pool : not null access Root_Storage_Pool'Class
      := System.Storage_Pools.Standard.Standard_Storage_Pool'Access
package Ada.Containers.Vectors is
...


However, there currently is no way to obtain an access value to the standard
storage pool, as far as I can tell.

Bob Duff noted in the email of the AI that one can obtain a declaration for the
standard pool, by using a renames, as in;

type My_Access_Type is access all String;

The_Standard_Storage_Pool: Root_Storage_Pool'Class
     renames My_Access_Type'Storage_Pool;

However one cannot use this technique to declare an aliased storage pool object,
which would be needed to have a default for a generic formal.

That's intentional; at least we've discussed this idea in the past and
determined it to not be worthwhile enough to support. Let me find the AI in
question ...

Ah, it's part of AI05-0001-1 (which defined the bounded forms). That AI notes
that specifying the storage pool as considered as an alternative to the bounded
forms, but that would be complicated to make work.

I wrote a long message in February 2006 on this topic (find it in the AI),
noting a variety of reasons why it isn't a good idea. You are only addressing
one, and it's the least important one. It might make sense for some other
container form, but not for the existing forms (it makes the
unbounded/indefinite forms unsafe [or at least appear unsafe], and the bounded
forms don't allocate anything anyway).

---

In any case, having this capability doesn't require changing AI12-0003-1 at all.
Remember that we already have an aspect for instantiations Default_Storage_Pool;
that can be used to change the pool used by an instance. So something like:

          package Foobar is new Ada.Containers.Vectors (Integer)
              with Default_Storage_Pool => My_Pool;

*might* have the effect you are looking for here. It might not work if the
implementation used an explicit pool in the definition of the container (there's
no requirement to use the default pool currently).

If we actually wanted to support user-defined pools in the containers, we'd need
to add some wording requiring the use of the default pool for allocations, as
well as a bunch of weasel wording about the container being erroneous if the
user-defined pool deallocates memory other than in reaction to a Deallocate
call, or if the user-defined pool does something not allowed by 13.11. Of
course, that might make some clever implementations illegal, so there'd be a
potential compatibility problem (one that I think wouldn't happen in practice,
but since the containers are an Ada 2005 thing, there are a number of
implementations and we surely don't know what they all do -- we'd have to
check).

But we certainly wouldn't need a name for the standard pool.

I read the reasons but didn't find them overly convincing.

1) There is no good way to name the default storage pool.
     - That wouldn't be the case if we found a good way to name the default
       storage pool. :-) But as you point out below, we probably don't need
       this, if we can generally override the default pool on an instantiation.

2) If people are worried about the safety of using a user-defined pool with a
     container, then they don't have to do that. Though I could see that they
     might be unpleasantly surprised if things didn't work well when switching
     to a different compiler vendor. As long as the pools allowed allocations of
     any size, and didn't attempt to do premature deallocation, I would think
     they should be relatively safe.

I didn't agree with the comment that the limitations meant that there wouldn't
be much in the way of useful storage pools that could be used with containers.

Some of the containers I am thinking of, might actually help improve general
performance issues such as those that are currently being discussed in the other
thread on tampering checks.

For example, if a container is only being used by one task, it might use a pool
that doesn't involve synchronization to obtain storage, which could be faster
than a malloc() like call.

Some container objects are only used as temporary objects that are disposed of
once the scope of the declaration is left. For those, it might make sense to use
a storage pool such as a subpool-based pool which follows a simple scheme that
only allocates storage from the end of a block, and does not have to worry about
freeing individual objects, and coalescing storage.

The programmer might want to supply a pool more suitable for a real-time
application, such as a TLSF algorithm (Two Level Segregated Fit), which has O(1)
cost for malloc, fre, realloc, and memalign.

http://www.gii.upv.es/tlsf/

An embedded system with limited memory resources might use a bounded pool of
storage with the unbounded containers, when one doesn't know the bounds to
specify for a bounded container, or might want to use a pool that can map the
storage to a specific location in memory.

etc.

Thanks for pointing that possibility out. That goes a long way to addressing the
need. I think I tried something like;

pragma  Default_Storage_Pool (My_Pool);

package Foobar is new Ada.Containers.Vectors (Integer);

which didn't seem to affect the instantiation, but I should try this again to
confirm. Or perhaps this is different than applying the aspect to the
instantiation?

Maybe it would help if there were implementation advice to not use
explicit pools in the definition of the standard containers.

I think they were more convincing in 2006; we didn't have bounded forms yet nor
subpools (block deallocation was never safe in a pool that contained controlled
objects).

It's not about "people being worried about the safety", it's about having to add
a long list of pool-related reasons that a container could be erroneous. That's
bad PR even for people who will never use a pool (wow, look at how unsafe these
things are!) Admittedly, that's in part because we want to be truthful. It also
would seem to be a portability problem, as a pool that would work with one
implementation's containers might not work with another's (including an
"improved" version of the original implementation's containers).

I don't like things that put implicit restrictions on implementations; it's the
standard's job to do that explicitly and then get out of the way.

That wouldn't buy much unless the container knew about the subpools; the
expensive operation (finalization) would still be performed on a
component-by-component basis and it would be done when the container wanted to
do it rather than being associated with the subpool destruction. Plus (of
course) that the container would put everything into the default subpool,
because it wouldn't know about that. Making every container use a pool with
subpools would be overkill, especially as the subpool would have to be specified
for each container for maximum flexibility.

I believe the pragma applies only to the generic, not to the instantiation.
That's why there is a separate aspect. (Well, I'm not that sure why it is this
way, but I'm sure there is some Bairdian reason. :-)

That'd be one way to handle it, I guess.

Certainly nonzero. And a nonzero chance of introducing a real incompatibility
with an existing implementation.

But don't we already have this case, with your claim that one can do the
following?

package Foobar is new Ada.Containers.Vectors (Integer)
     with Default_Storage_Pool => My_Pool;

Incidentally, I tried this with one of the Ada 2012 vendors, ;-)

but got the error message,

    "aspect identifier expected".

And to confirm, I also tried

pragma Default_Storage_Pool (My_Pool);
package Foobar is new Ada.Containers.Vectors (Integer);

But this did not result in the usage of My_Pool.

Maybe the vendor has not fully implemented the pragma yet, or is choosing to
ignore it here....

Since we apparently already support user-defined pools with the
containers via supplying an aspect on the instantiation, perhaps this
wording is already needed. :-)

If we decide we want that for other reasons, it might be best to think of it as
"A standard pool" (as opposed to "THE..."), because in the past, people were
worried that "the standard pool" implies that implementations must by default
use the same pool for all types. There is no such implication:  "the standard
pool" just needs to be suitable for all types (must support all sizes and
alignments). The implementation can use some other pool(s) if it likes.

It's not a "claim", it's 13.11.3(5/3).

And you're right, in that we forgot to say something about the effect of that on
language-defined packages. We should have either said that it will work, or that
it won't. As it stands, it's a crap shoot - use is non-portable at best, plus it
might even break some implementation of some package (what happens for I/O
packages that allocate file blocks on the heap? Etc.). We shouldn't have put
vendors at that sort of risk.

They obviously failed to implement 13.11.3(5/3). A bug report would be a good
idea. (And an ACATS test would be appreciated as well -- one of the most
important benefits of ACATS tests is that they reduce errors of omission, as no
one can forget to implement something that is tested.)

Right, that's by definition. The pragma operates on the generic unit, and it is
whatever is defined in the generic unit that is used in the absence of the
aspect.

> choosing to ignore it here....

No, their implementation is correct in this case. The pragma should only have an
effect when the generic unit is compiled (and you're not compiling
Ada.Containers.Vectors).

You're right that there is a problem, but it's a general one about the effect of
this aspect on language-defined generics. Any language-defined generic could
have this aspect used, but it might make trouble for many of them. I mentioned
files above, but any language-defined package that uses the heap is at risk.

We at a minimum need a blanket statement about language-defined packages in
13.11.3. (The easy thing is to declare it erroneous, but that might be
overkill.) Whether to require it to be meaningful for containers is a separate
but related question. Either way, we need an AI.

Attached is a B test and a C test I just wrote to test this and other things
stated in 13.11.3 (5/3)

The tests expose several issues that are not working correctly with GNAT GPL
2014 with respect to the Default_Storage_Pool pragma.

[Editor's note: you can find the tests in a forthcoming ACATS update.]

:-)

In your defense, I just noticed that I didn't have the aspect in the list of
Ada 2012 things to test, either. It turns out that I forgot to mention it in
the AARM extension note 13.11.3(9.c/3), so anyone who actually trusted those
rather than carefully reading the text of the Standard probably missed it.

OTOH, the pragma Default_Storage_Pool has an assigned priority of 8 for
testing, which meant that I would have soon created a test for it had Brad not
done it first. So Brad merely pushed the pain up a couple of months...
