!subject Make protected objects more protecting

!summary

A Boolean aspect Exclusive_Functions is added to the language.

!problem 

The design of containers assumes that they are not accessed
concurrently, on the ground that access can be protected with
protected objects if necessary.

However, containers provide functions that modify the state of the
container; it is therefore not possible to access these through
protected functions, as these can be called concurrently.

!proposal

Add a boolean aspect "exclusive_functions" for protected types and
single protected objects to forbid concurrent execution of protected
functions.

!wording

Add a new subclause C.8   Protected Object Locking

For a type declared by a protected_type_declaration or for the
anonymous type of an object declared by a single_protected_declaration,
the following language-defined type-related representation aspect
may be specified:

   Exclusive_Functions -
     The type of aspect Exclusive_Functions is Boolean.

     If the Exclusive_Functions aspect of a protected type is True, then
     a new protected action is not started on a protected object of the type
     while another protected action on the same protected object is underway,
     even if both actions are the result of a call on a protected function.
     [In other words, protected functions are treated the same as protected
     procedures with respect to mutual exclusion.]

AARM Ramification: This aspect cannot be specified on a derived protected
type or a protected interface. We don't want to force implementations to
to be able to regenerate the body of the protected type with different
locking.

!discussion

According ARM A(3/2), there is no correctness guarantee on concurrent
calls involving overlapping objects passed by reference. Indeed, most
implementations of the standard containers break when the same
container is used concurrently, even when the container is declared
constant.

The usual way of allowing concurrent access to unsafe objects is to
encapsulate them in a protected object.

However, protected functions still allow concurrent access to (a
constant view) of private objects. So the most natural way of writing
a protected container is still unsafe:

   protected type Protected_Container is
      procedure Insert (Key : in Key_Type; Element : in Element_Type);
      function Element (Key : in Key_Type) return Element_Type;
   private
      Unsafe_Container : Ordered_Map_Instance.Map;
   end Protected_Container;

Moreover, there is no easy way to actually realize this is unsafe,
since it compiles without warning, and concurrent read access on usual
objects is usually safe.

Programmers aware about the issue can restrict themselves to use only
protected procedures and entries, which guarantees non-concurrency on
private data:

   protected type Safe_Protected_Container is
      procedure Insert (Key : in Key_Type; Element : in Element_Type);
      procedure Element (Key : in Key_Type; Element : out Element_Type);
   private
      Unsafe_Container : Ordered_Map_Instance.Map;
   end Safe_Protected_Container;

However, such a procedure Element is counter-intuitive, and makes
client code heavier because contained elements can no longer be used
in a more complex expression, explicit temporary variables have to be
used instead.

Also, this construction only works when Element_Type is definite. To
use indefinite containers safely by using only protected procedures
and entries, another layer is needed, e.g. using an indefinite holder
or an access type.

Moreover, the whole workaround is fragile, since there is no way to
ensure protected functions won't be carelessly added in the future by
a programmer not aware of the rationale.

So current version of Ada doesn't seem to adequately allow concurrency
protection for objects whose read-only concurrent access is not safe,
like standard containers, but it can be the case for user types as
well.

It would be much easier and foolproof to have an aspect for protected
types, protected objects, and/or individual protected functions, that
make protected function have concurrency semantics of protected
procedures, ensuring non-concurrent use of private objects, while
remaining syntactically a function.

From an implementation point of view, it would just mean that
protected function calls would use the same semaphore as protected
procedures; some implementations may even already use only one kind of
semaphores for both. Implementation burden would likely range from
null to minimal.

No impact.

This is my homework from the last meeting, although I subcontracted most of
it to Natacha Porté who initially raised the issue (she's the one in the CC).

To me, this does not seem completely appropriate for an "aspect."  This is a
significant semantic change and should probably be reflected in a
corresponding syntax change for protected functions.

Now that we allow in-out parameters for function, perhaps something like the
following would communicate the idea:

protected type Protected_Container is
   ...
   function Element (in out Protected_Container; Key : in Key_Type) return Element_Type;
   ...

This particular proposal seems like a bad idea for several reasons:
    1) Protected operation declarations do not normally mention the
       protected object as an explicit parameter; this proposal is
       therefore *very* different.

    2) The "current instance" rule means that the name
       "Protected_Container" in the proposed declaration of
       Element denotes an object, not a type. (Obviously this
       objection could be worked around as was done with
       access_definitions).

    3) Ambiguity. Is the explicit parameter instead of or in
       addition to the usual implicit parameter? Again, this could
       be worked around but it would be ugly.

#1 is really the main objection.

However, I agree with your objection to the original proposal.

Perhaps this could be addressed by defining a new Convention; that might also
help straighten out any interactions with interface types.

Not such a big change, as it simply forces a semantic that is already allowed.
Certainly not as big as synchronization => by_entry

I tend to agree with J-P here.  What's the big deal?

Me too. This is just turning off an implementation permission. Sounds like an
aspect to me.

I withdraw my objection to the aspect proposal.

My objection would stand if we were talking about allowing functions to have
a non-constant view of the protected object, but we aren't.

I presumed we were wanting to be "honest" about the parameter mode for the
protected object.  I suppose if we are just keeping a constant view, then the
aspect is adequate.
