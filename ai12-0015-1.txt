!proposal

There ought to be some standard way of retrieving compilation unit information.

AI95-0282-1 suggests that the most appropriate way of doing this is with
attributes of some sort. AI95-0282-1 was discussed at the February 2002 and
October 2003 ARG meetings. Highlights of that discussion: The IBM/Rational compiler
does not have line number information to report because of their incremental
compilation technology; they use "source position" for debugging. It is suggested
that the information be in terms of the enclosing call rather than the position of
the attribute usage. A design similar to Exception_Information is suggested.
Finally, the AI was killed because it was not deemed important enough.

!wording

Create a new subclause Annex C.8 containing:

C.8 Source Info

This subclause describes functions that can be used to obtain the name of the
current source file, current line number, enclosing entity (current subprogram,
package, task, entry or protected subprogram), date of compilation and time of
compilation.

C.8.1 The Package Source_Info

Static Semantics

The following language-defined library package exists:

package Ada.Source_Info is

   function Compilation_Date return String with
     Import, Convention => Intrinsic;

   function Compilation_Time return String with
     Import, Convention => Intrinsic;

   function Compiler_Version return String with
     Import, Convention => Intrinsic;

   function Enclosing_Entity return String with
     Import, Convention => Intrinsic;

   function File return String with
     Import, Convention => Intrinsic;

   function Line return Long_Integer with
     Import, Convention => Intrinsic;

   function Source_Location return String with
     Import, Convention => Intrinsic;

end Ada.Source_Info;

The function Compilation_Date returns the date of compilation. The format of
the string is implementation-defined.

The function Compilation_Time returns the time of compilation. The format of
the string is implementation-defined.

The function Compiler_Version returns the compiler version.  The format of the
string is implementation-defined.

The function Enclosing_Entity returns the name of the current subprogram,
package, task, entry or protected subprogram. The format of the string is
implementation-defined.  It is also implementation-defined whether, when this
function is used at the outer level of a generic package, the string returned
is the name of the instance or the name of the generic package.

The function File returns the name of the current file, not including the path
information.

The function Line returns the current input line number.

The function Source_Location returns a string literal of the form "name:line",
where name is the current source file name without path information, and line
is the current line number. It is implementation-defined whether, when
instantiations are involved, the location of the instance is also included.

!discussion

I've suggested a new section Annex C.8 as it is obtaining info known to "the
system", similar to C.7 for task info.  Also Annex C is "special needs", not
mandated.  Any other ideas welcome.

The words are derived from GNAT, with details such as string formats made
implementation-defined, the line number made Long_Integer instead of
Positive (in case of 16-bit integers having insufficient range) and with the
addition of Compiler_Version, as suggested by J-P. Rosen.

For my projects, Enclosing_Entity is important for the elaboration of our
middleware.  Source_Location is useful for fault reporting.  The other
functions I've just included for compatibility with GNAT.

** TBD.

Is there any standard way of retrieving compilation unit information via some
mechanism in the Ada standard packages?

In C/C++ compilers, there are common standard or vendor predefined macros:
__FILE__, __LINE__ __function__ etc.

It is often useful to have programs report (for developers) the package,
routine, etc were something of interest occurred.

With Ada, generics add complexity, as you often desire to know which
instantiation of the generic encountered that interesting something.

I noticed GNAT.Source_Information. Is there any likelihood that anything similar
might become part of some future Ada standard?

No. This was discussed in the past, the context of Ada 2005, and it was rejected
for reasons that I no longer remember. This was recorded in AI95-00282-1 (look
it up on the Ada-auth.org site, and if you want more information, I'd suggest
looking in the meeting minutes for that AI number).

I vaguely remember difficulties defining precisely what the functions are
expected to return, in cases like inlining and generic instantiation, because
different implementations do these things differently. If we just allowed
implementations to do what they want in those cases, any such information would
be much less useful. (Imagine not knowing whether you would get information from
a generic body or an instance of that body -- very different things.)

Anyway, I think we would need to see stronger use-cases than just "some other
language provides X", especially as we've already considered this once
unsuccessfully. (Whether we'd reconsider also would depend on whether there were
genuine technical difficulties with the old proposal or it was judged not
important enough.)

I suggest adding:

 function Compiler_Version return String with
     Import, Convention => Intrinsic;

The function Compiler_Version returns an implementation-defined string that
identifies the compiler version. The result is considered to be a static
expression.

(I am surprised that this is not provided by Gnat. It is certainly important for
tool makers, as well as for users who have baselined compilers and want to be
able to rebuild an exact same executable)

How is this expected to work for a compiler like the old Rational one that does
not keep line numbers? (See the old discussion of AI05-0282-1.)

What happens if the line number is outside of Positive (that could happen on
Janus/Ada, as Integer is 16-bits for compatibility with older Janus/Ada
versions)?

"Considered a static expression" is not an Ada capability, and I would be very
adverse to adding it in an ad-hoc manner.

This needs a lot more explanation, especially for the generic case. That most
certainly is not a "note"!!

How could the expected meaning work in a shared generic? Do you really mean to
incur distributed overhead for all generics just in case someone might use this
function in a generic body???

--------------------

When we discussed AI05-0282-1 (the last time we considered this idea), the GNAT
"magic package" approach was considered a bad idea. We instead considered
attributes of compilation units or something on the line of Ada.Exceptions. I'm
not sure what has changed (other than the membership and jobs of the ARG).

You mean AI95-00282.

That opinion was not unanimous.

I think I still think so.  I might change my mind if there were more than one
Ada compiler (i.e. Ada 2012 compiler) in the world.  But today, if you want
this feature in Ada, you can use GNAT.

Certainly the Rationale compiler was the reason why this stalled before, but
I thought the whole point why this issue had been resurrected was that the
Rationale compiler was deemed to no longer be relevant.  And as the suggestion
is to add this to Annex C, which is special needs, compilers don’t have to
provide it.

That seems as bizarre as having a string whose bounds aren’t Positive.

Ok, I realise that staticness is a bit of a hot potato at the moment,
that could be cut.

My other option had been to make the format of all the strings
implementation-defined, so what exactly info pops out for generic
instantiations could be implementation defined too.

I'm sure the people at PTC (where that compiler lives now, as "Ada
Developer") would be surprised to hear that. I always call it "old Rational
compiler" when I write about it because I don't think most readers would
instantly know what "PTC Ada Developer" is (or even what PTC is, since it has
changed names and owners so many times: Alsys, Thompson, Aonix, Atego, PTC,
did I miss any??). While I don't know for sure, I'd certainly be surprised if
the architecture of that compiler has changed much since the Pascal/Steve days.

In any case, this came up because someone asked on Ada-Comment, and it wasn't
immediately killed in Madrid because you said your group used it. My
understanding is we wanted to know how your group used it (which you couldn't
remember off-hand); it certainly wasn't anything about particular compilers or
lack thereof.

I suppose that's formally true, but virtually everyone supports Annex C,
'cause the stuff in it is necessary to do anything serious. Besides, it isn't
useful to "standardize" something if half of the Ada compilers out there can't
support it. This isn't the GNAT Standard, it's the Ada Standard (and if it was
only about GNAT, there'd be no reason to standardize it in the first place).

Your point? It's allowed by the RM, so we need to answer the question (or
change the RM so it isn't allowed). What we can't do is effectively change the
required size of Integer from some obscure Annex capability -- that needs to be
done explicitly if done at all.

That would work, of course, but I have to wonder how useful it would be. You
said that this (Enclosing_Entity) was the function that you used most in your
projects (for "elaboration of your middleware", whatever that is).
Would it still be useful if it reported different answers on different
compilers? (I can't tell, because I don't know how it is used in the
"elaboration of your middleware".)

For the record, this feels to me more like an attribute or attributes of an
entity rather than a magic package. Magic packages are something we've tried
to avoid in Ada, it's much preferable that packages can be implemented in Ada.

Ah, well I don’t think I’d have taken the AI if I’d realised that there’s no
chance of it going anywhere because of the same old reason.

Ah (again), I mistakenly thought that you were after negative line numbers
rather than a bigger range.  Pity there’s no Long_Positive.

The usefulness of this proposed package is rapidly declining!  I’d have to
check further when I’m back at work as to what exactly what entities we’re
interested in, and whether any are instantiations.

Can't use Long_Integer here, as it is an optional type. I think you'd have to
use:

   type Line_Numbers is range <implementation-defined>;

   function Line return Line_Numbers with
      Convention => Intrinsic;

(BTW, why is "Import" here? The RM doesn't care how the body is implemented!)

This is effectively what we use inside the Janus/Ada compiler (we have a package
called Host which defines types to use on the particular Host; that includes a
line number type and a line position type, among others.

Since Ada does define a date and time format, we could make these more useful to
requiring that. [Function Image, from 9.6.1(81/2).] Or, even better, have this
return a Calendar.Time so the full range of operations are available.

----------------------

It was previously suggested that this be an attribute rather than a magic package.
That would look something like:

For all entities, the following attribute is defined:

Src_Info  Returns details of the source for the entity; of
          type Ada.Information.Source_Information.

The following package is defined:

    with Ada.Calendar;
    package Ada.Information is
        type Source_Information is limited private;

        type Line_Numbers is range <implementation-defined>;

        function Line (Info : Source_Information) return Line_Numbers;

        function Simple_Name (Info : Source_Information) return String;

        function Full_Name (Info : Source_Information) return String;

        function Enclosing_Entity (Info : Source_Information) return String;

        function Compilation_Time (Info : Source_Information) return Ada.Calendar.Time;

        function Compiler_Version (Info : Source_Information) return String;

        function File return String (Info : Source_Information) return String;

    end Ada.Information;

with definitions of these routines similar to yours.

The use of an attribute on an entity gives a clear location in the source,
which doesn't change due to maintenance or tools use. And it avoids having some
calls have magic properties (the magic properties, if any, are associated with
the attribute, a construct which is intended to describe magic properties in
Ada).

An alternative would be to use two attributes, one for all entities (with the
entity information), and one for compilation units (with the compilation
information). Not sure that's worth the complexity, but it would keep the
amount of information down a bit.
