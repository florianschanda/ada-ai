!problem

Lock-free structures are all the rage these days. If one wanted to construct
such a structure in Ada, one might use Atomic objects. But Ada does not
provide any compare-and-swap operation (or other read-write locked operations,
like atomic increment). The RM has Implementation Advice that package
Machine_Code include such operations - C.1(11-12), but that is the absolute
opposite of a portable operation.

!proposal

(See Summary.)

!wording

** TBD. The author is not going to try to propose anything here, as people
more knowledgeable about common machine architectures should do that. He notes
that he mainly is aware of test-and-set operations and never heard of
compare-and-swap until this discussion. :-)

!discussion

It seems that the solution will need to be generic, in order to work with any
atomic type. For that to make sense, it seems necessary to allow aspect Atomic
to be given on a formal type, in order to require any actual type is indeed
atomic. The alternative of just saying that if the type is not atomic, then the
operation isn't either, seems error-prone.

--

Author's note: One thing I learned from this discussion is that at least some
the literature uses "Lock-Free" to mean "free of deadlocks and livelocks"
rather than the obvious meaning of "has no locks". Those are two wildly
different things! Surely a tool could determine if a protected object is
deadlock free; whether the implementation contains locks obviously out of the
hands of tools. Moreover, almost all synchronized data has something that is
acting like a lock (that is, some synchronization data); the exact form of
that data should be irrelevant outside of performance concerns.

!ASIS

No ASIS effect.

An ACATS C-Test is needed to check that the new capabilities are supported.

Will Ada 202x have support for lock-free data structures?  An API along the
style of the GNAT Lock_Free pragma or a generic package like I made at
https://sstewartgallus.com/git?p=linted.git;a=blob;f=src/ada-core/src/linted-gcc
_atomics.ads;h=a87061e74aa3a7badcfcd7cd0f0f5c0f2abe1908;hb=HEAD that mirrors
C++'s support might be useful.  Also, a function for x86's pause instruction or
similar would be useful.

This would all be useful for hard-real time platforms that need very strict
timing guarantees.

The Lock_Free pragma would probably be easiest for formalizing in SPARK and
such.

> Will Ada 202x have support for lock-free data structures?

No idea; no one has formally asked until 30 minutes ago. In particular, the
real-time folks at IRTAW have not (yet?) forwarded any proposals in this idea.
Generally, we let them take the lead on real-time issues.

And in any case, it is the wrong question. A lock-free data structure is a
specific solution, not a problem or capability. Ada already provides a wide
variety of ways to write data structures for multitasking, from the very low
level (aspects Atomic and Volatile) to the nicely abstract (protected objects
and rendezvous).

We need to know what cannot be done with the existing features.

No one seems interested in explaining what they cannot do in Ada, but rather
seem interested in following the herd to use solutions cooked up for languages
that don't have the abstract multitasking capabilities of Ada. In many cases,
there are better ways to do in Ada what you might have to do in some low-level
manner in some other language. (And that's often true in other areas of Ada as
well -- OOP in particular.)

In particular, I'd like to know the following. (Aside: I always tell people that
I know just enough about multitasking to be dangerous, so please humor me if you
think these things are obvious.)

What capabilities (precisely) are missing from Ada in order for it to directly
support low-level lock-free data structures? We most certainly would not want to
add a bunch of new low-level capabilities, but rather would want to extend the
existing facilities to better support low-level lock-free data structures. It
seems obvious to me that Ada needs a portable atomic test-and-set operation, but
I don't know if that is enough nor whether that is really practical. Nor is the
best form to define that obvious (it would have to be implemented as a built-in
in order to get the intended special semantics, which complicates
implementation).

And the even more important question: in general use, what can you do with a
lock-free data structure that you cannot do with a protected object? After all,
if you can use a PO to accomplish your task, you should do that as it is far
more abstract and portable than any particular implementation could be. And by
using a PO, you are letting the compiler chose the most efficient way to
implement your data structure for your target rather than making an assumption
that very well may be wrong. (Programmers are notoriously bad at determining the
efficiency of code and the importance of efficiency of particular code.)

Your thoughts (and anyone's, for that matter) on this topics would help guide
thinking on these topics.

Note that AdaCore supports a pragma Lock_Free that can be applied to protected
types to cause them to use lock-free primitives (or complain if not possible):

  http://docs.adacore.com/gnat_rm-docs/html/gnat_rm/gnat_rm/implementation_defined_pragmas.html#pragma-lock-free

Be that as it may, I sympathize with having access to a Compare_And_Swap
primitive applicable to atomic objects, since most hardware supports that at
this point, and from it you can implement essentially any lock-free structure.

Thanks Tuck; I was aware of that.

That just seems to me to be an inversion -- the compiler ought to select the
best implementation, not make the user guess what implementation is best on
their target. (I realize this sort of inversion is ingrained in computing;
aspect Inline is another example of this sort of inversion -- and I don't like
it much either.)

It seems clear that there is a hole when creating low-level algorithms (no
test-and-set), it's much less obvious that there is such a hole for protected
objects (after all, most of anything in a program is not performance critical,
so restructuring your data structures to fit some lock-free profile just makes
your code harder to understand in most cases). And one assumes that compilers do
the best they can for a data structure and don't just fall back on some general
algorithm. (What compiler vendor wants to generate slower than necessary
code???)

I'm sorry I meant capabilities for implementing lock-free data  structures.
Standard library support for common data structures is an entirely separate
question.  Under current standard Ada it is not possible to implement certain
data structures that guarantee forward progress among all threads without
delving into low-level assembly.

Unfortunately, current Atomics support does not provide for
compare_and_exchange primitives and similar and so cannot support  user-written
lock-free data structures.

> We need to know what cannot be done with the existing features.

Atomic swaps, compare_and_swaps and processor specific thread yield
instructions.  Also, less strongly ordered atomics that are less expensive.

You realize the standard library has to be implemented somewhere right?
On some platforms there is no Ada standard library or a very reduced set  of
capabilities and people have to implement such capability themselves. And as
stated previously, there is NO way to implement the timing  guarantees such as
lock-freedom or wait-freedom in standard Ada.  Also,  these capabilities cannot
be used inside interrupts or signal handlers.

The C++ and C standards have a somewhat reasonable API.  I gave an  example of
two possible APIs.  The Lock_Free pragma of GNAT and the  generic package
wrapper over intrinsics provided by GCC.

I think the Lock_Free pragma approach might be easiest for static  analysers
such as SPARK to analyze and so would be most suited for  hard-real time
support.  On the other hand, it wouldn't work for  wait-freedom requirements.

The barest mimimal requirements are probably atomic exchange, atomic  compare
and exchange and nop or yield instruction.  All else can be  implemented using
them.  However, certain atomics cannot be implemented  in a wait-free way
without being built in and instead must be lock-free.

You cannot guarantee special properties such as wait-freedom, or  lock-freedom.

In some cases, lock-free implementations are required for correctness. For
example, in glibc, we allegedly cannot use the GCC atomic built-ins because they
could be implemented with locks, and that wouldn't give us the wrong behavior.

With that background, this GNAT-specific assertion that the compiler must use
lock-free operations is useful.

It's very visible with POSIX shared mappings (either anonymous or file-backed).  It would matter with I/O memory mappings, too.

It also affects the program semantics when signals are involved.
Lock-based implementations of atomics can deadlock too easily.

The problems are so numerous that it's been concluded (at least on the glibc
side) that if the architecture does not support certain atomics, the only way to
emulate them if required is with a kernel assist.

One interesting side note about lock-free vs. wait-free — a relatively recent
paper documented some research which showed that the effort to produce a
“wait-free” structure was rarely worthwhile.  Most “lock-free” structures were
nearly wait free, without incurring all the complexity of a true “wait-free”
algorithm.  See the paper by Alistarh, Censor-Hillel, and Shavit:

   "Are Lock-Free Concurrent Algorithms Practically Wait-Free?”

   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paper-18.pdf

In any case, I support coming up with a simple standard Ada package for compiler
implementors to provide access to Compare-and-Swap and perhaps a few additional
operations.

If you go down the route of exposing hardware compare-and-swap operations, I
would recommend also exposing other widely supported read-modify-write
operations, such as swap or fetch-increment/decrement. They are less general
than CAS, but where applicable, they enable better algorithms (no ABA issues, no
expensive fail-and-retry loop).

One example of application for atomic swap is triple buffering (producer
transactionally updates a shared RAM value whenever it feels like it, consumer
can access the latest update at any point in time), and one example of
application for fetch-increment/decrement is reference counting.

Some of the IRTAW members participate in ARG. In particular, Alan Burns, Brad
Moore and myself participate. IRTAW holds a workshop approximately every 18-24
months. The last one was held in Benicassim, Spain in April 2016. The next one
will either be in the fall of 2017 or spring of 2018.

IRTAW has been resistant to putting such mechanisms into the Ada language,
preferring instead to permit Ada to use such mechanisms to make mechanisms such
as protected types/objects, tasks, etc. more efficient.

The mechanism to interface with IRTAW is to watch for the announcement of the
next workshop and submit a position paper to attempt to get the issue on the
agenda and to come and participate. If you want, I will communicate with the
organizer of the next workshop and ensure that interested people receive a
direct email announcing the workshop when it is issued.

?? Atomic objects themselves force sequential actions; there's no "signalling"
involved. And C.6 makes it clear that may require barriers or fences. What else
makes sense (whatever the rules are have to make sense in a wide variety of

The standard library is always going to be implementation-specific (and often
target-specific as well); there is very little of the GNAT standard library code
that would work on Janus/Ada, for one example.

Thus, there (A) is no need for portability in the implementation of the standard
library (meaning that the Ada Standard isn't particularly relevant there) and
(B) depending on implementation-specific features is fine. Which means that is a
terrible example!

Which brings one back to the original question, why isn't a protected object
good enough for that?

I'm very skeptical that any useful timing guarantees could ever be made in a
high-level language. I can't tell how long a piece of sequential code produced
by my compiler will take to run even on the various Intel machines I have here
(it seems to vary as much as a factor of 4 from what I would estimate). Truly
portable code that runs on many different processors would be beyond
predictable. Mixing that in with the different costs of synchronization on
different targets and nothing but the most trivial can have any guarantee.

But I'm at the limits of my knowledge here. While it seems to me that the actual
implementation of a protected object should not matter (if it has the correct
form, it cannot by itself cause deadlock or livelock, and that form can be
easily checked by a tool), lots of other people seem to differ. Perhaps they're
all focused on the wrong thing (I certainly think so), but obviously I may be
missing some key information.

...
>  You cannot guarantee special properties such as wait-freedom, or
> lock-freedom.

I'd argue that it's not the job of a programming language to guarantee anything,
especially when it comes to timing. (These properties seem misnamed as they
generally are meant to make timing guarantees rather than an implementation
guarantee. I can see no reason that a properly implemented lock could not make
the same guarantee.)  And the implementation of a protected object doesn't
really matter in terms of whether those properties hold -- it's just the form of
the contents that matters. That seems easy to check with tools like SPARK.

Anyway, I've said enough, I'll let others more knowledgeable weigh in if they
want.
