!subject Nonblocking subprograms
!summary

Aspect Nonblocking is added.

!problem

During a protected action, it is a bounded error to invoke an operation that
is potentially blocking. There is currently no mechanism (other than a comment)
to specify that a given subprogram is intended to be safely callable during a
protected action (i.e., that the subprogram will not invoke an operation that
is potentially blocking). This seems like a useful part of a subprogram's
"contract" that should be (optionally) specifiable at the point of a
subprogram's declaration.

!proposal

Add an aspect Nonblocking.

!wording

Add at the end of 9.5.1 (as continuation of bounded error section?)

  For a callable entity or a generic subprogram, the following
  language-defined representation aspect may be specified:
 
      The type of aspect Nonblocking is Boolean. When aspect Nonblocking is
      True for an entity, the entity is said to be nonblocking.
      If directly specified, the aspect_definition shall be a static
      expression. [This aspect is never inherited;] if not directly
      specified, the aspect is False.

      When a callable entity is nonblocking, a call to the
      entity is considered to be within a protected operation for
      purposes of the check described above that is associated
      with invoking an operation that is potentially blocking
      (including interactions with pragma Detect_Blocking (see H.5)).
      In addition, a call to an entity that is not a nonblocking
      entity is considered potentially blocking for the purposes of the
      check.

        AARM Ramification: This implies, if Detect_Blocking is set, that
        calling a potentially blocking operation from the body of Nonblocking
        subprogram raises Program_Error. That includes calling any
        non-nonblocking subprograms.

        AARM Implementation Note: We make calling non-nonblocking subprograms
        from the body of a nonblocking subprogram a bounded error so that
        the check can be made statically in the case that pragma Detect_Blocking
        is in force. We certainly do not want distributed overhead in the
        case where pragma Detect_Blocking is in force, a nonblocking subprogram
        that is called from outside of a protected action then calls a normal
        subprogram that uses a potentially blocking operation (this case would
        require an extra TCB flag or the like to be reliably detected, which
        is required in the presence of the pragma).

      A subprogram shall be nonblocking if it overrides a dispatching
      nonblocking procedure. In addition to the places where Legality
      Rules normally apply (see 12.3), this rule applies also in the
      private part of an instance of a generic unit.

!discussion

We've modeled this aspect after No_Return, which has a similar purpose
and presumably has already worked out the needed rules.

For this reason, we don't have nonblocking access-to-subprogram types.
One could imagine such a thing, but it would take a number of additional
rules and certainly it wouldn't be "keeping it simple".

The rules do not allow calling "normal" subprograms from a nonblocking
subprogram. This allows detecting any potentially blocking operations used
in a nonblocking subprogram statically. This is important if pragma
Detect_Blocking is used, as such detection is required. (Otherwise, this
is just a bounded error and the "mistake" can be ignored with the usual
consequences.)

!example

Using this feature to create an array of tasks that "know" their index
within the array:

    subtype Worker_Indexes is Natural range 1 .. 20;

    task type Worker (Index : Worker_Indexes := 1) is ...

    type Task_Array (Worker_Indexes) of Worker;

    function Creator (Index : Worker_Indexes) return Worker is
    begin
        return Result : Worker (Index);
    end Creator;

    Worker_Tasks : Task_Array :=
       (for Index in Worker_Indexes => Creator (Index));

All of these tasks will be activated together, and they will know
their position in the array (so that they can communicate directly
with the neighbors) without needing an initialization entry call
(which necessarily would serialize the starting of the tasks).

!reference 4.3.3
!from Adam Beneschan 13-01-24
!discussion

This is a proposal to allow "for <index_parameter> in
<discrete_choice_list>" in place of a <discrete_choice_list> in a
named array aggregate, where the expression on the right may refer to
the index parameter.  For instance:

   (for I in 1 .. 5 => I * I)

would be equivalent to the array aggregate

   (1 => 1, 2 => 4, 3 => 9, 4 => 16, 5 => 25)

This has been proposed in the past; Dan Eilers made a similar
suggestion before Ada 95 was adopted.  More recently, Phil Clayton
suggested the above syntax in July 2010; see the thread in
comp.lang.ada at

http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.ada/browse_thread/thread/334f9012742e58fc

(scroll down to Phil's first post in the thread).  Although the
proposal would be syntactic sugar in a case like the above, since you
can declare an array object and use a FOR loop to assign to each
element, it was pointed out in the comp.lang.ada thread that this
can't be done when the element type is limited.  In that case, a
syntax like

   (for I in 1 .. Count => Function_Returning_Lim (I))

where Function_Returning_Lim returns a limited type, might provide a
way to create an aggregate that would be difficult to create
otherwise. 

I've decided to try to come up with the RM changes myself, in the hope
that I might save someone else some work if this idea is pursued
(although I'm sure some editing would still be needed).

!wording

Change 4.3.3(5/2) to:

array_component_association ::=
   discrete_choice_list => expression
 | discrete_choice_list => <>
 | parameterized_array_component_association

Add after 4.3.3(5/2):

parameterized_array_component_association ::=
  for defining_identifier in discrete_choice_list => expression

A parameterized_array_component_association declares an index
parameter, which is an object whose type is the corresponding index
type.  If the discrete_choice_list is a single nonstatic
choice_expression or range, the constraint of the object's subtype is
the single value given by the choice_expression, or it is defined by
the range; otherwise, the bounds of the subtype's constraint are the
smallest and largest values covered by the discrete_choice_list.

Change 4.3.3(23) to:

2.  The array component expressions of the aggregate are evaluated in an
arbitrary order and their values are converted to the component
subtype of the array type; an array component expression is evaluated
once for each associated component.  For a
parameterized_array_component_association, before an array component
expression is evaluated for an associated component, the index of that
component is assigned to the index parameter.

Add to the end of 3.1(6/3):

In addition, a parameterized_array_component_association is a
declaration of its defining_identifier.

Add somewhere in 8.1(2-6):

. a parameterized_array_component_association;

Change the last sentence of 3.3.1(23/3) to:

An object declared by a loop_parameter_specification,
iterator_specification, parameter_specification,
entry_index_specification, choice_parameter_specification,
parameterized_array_component_association,
extended_return_statement, or a formal_object_declaration of mode in
out is not considered a stand-alone object.


NOTE on 4.3.3(17/3):

I don't think any change is required here; for the legality rules, a
discrete_choice_list in a parameterized_array_component_association
has the same effect as a discrete_choice_list in the other two types
of array_component_associations.  I don't think any wording change is
necessary, but for clarity it might be useful to change the first
phrase to

The discrete_choice_list of an array_component_association (including
the discrete_choice_list of a
parameterized_array_component_association) is allowed ...

Similarly for 4.3.3(27).


NOTE: In the aggregate 

   (1 .. 10 => Func_Call)

the component expressions are evaluated in an arbitrary order (by
4.3.3(23)), which means that if Func_Call has side effects and
returns a different value each time, you can't count on which result
of Func_Call will be assigned to which component.  I'm assuming that
the same would be true for 

   (for I in 1 .. 10 => Func_Call (I))

i.e. you can't tell which value will be passed to Func_Call first.
I'm assuming that no additional language is necessary, but a note in
the NOTES section could be helpful to avoid confusion, since people
could assume it would iterate like a for_loop_statement.

Note that this proposal allows anything that would be allowed in a
discrete_choice_list, e.g.

   Arr : Int_Array (1 .. 15) := 
            (for I in 1 | 3 | 6 | 10 .. 15 => I, 
             for J in others => -J);
