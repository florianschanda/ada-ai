!summary

Add restriction No_Tasks_Unassigned_To_CPU to provide safe use of Ravenscar.

!problem

The Ravenscar Profile on multiprocessors requires that all tasks are assigned
to CPUs. In order to do this safely, we need a new restriction to be defined
to ensure that all tasks are assigned to a CPU.

!proposal

(See Summary.)

!wording

This AI assumes that AI12-0055-1 has been adopted.

Add a new restriction after D.7(10.8/3):

No_Tasks_Unassigned_To_CPU
    No aspect CPU is specified to be statically Not_A_Specific_CPU.
    If there is any task in the partition which has aspect CPU specified,
    then all tasks in the partition have aspect CPU or Dispatching_Domain
    specified.

AARM Ramification: If this restriction is used in a context for which
restriction Only_Static_Task_Assignment is not in effect, then tasks
could specify CPU with a non-static expression having the value
Not_A_Specific_CPU. Thus it is of limited utility outside of Ravenscar
and similar environments.

!discussion

We add a new restriction:

    No_Tasks_Unassigned_To_CPU

to signify that (1) Not_A_Specific_CPU is not allowed in aspect CPU or 
pragma CPU, and (2) either no CPU aspect is used in the program so that 
all tasks get assigned to the environment task's CPU or all tasks have a 
CPU aspect.

Note that the restriction allows either CPU or Dispatching_Domain to
be specified, so that it can be used in non-Ravenscar contexts. We could
have included a run-time check that the CPU is never specified to
Not_A_Specific_CPU (raising an exception if that is true), but it would
seem to get in the way of the primary purpose of this restriction (which
is for Ravenscar).

!ASIS

No ASIS impact.

!ACATS test

An ACATS C-Test is needed to verify that the pragma and restriction is
implemented as specified.
