!summary

** TBD.

!question

It is unspecified what happens if Ada.Directories.Create_Path partially
succeeds. That is, if the call manages to create some (outer) directories
but fails later on an (inner) directory.

This should be specified.

!recommendation

The call should leave any created directories when it fails. Attempting
to clean up could not be guaranteed (what if the attempt to remove also
fails?) and is much harder to implement (requiring handlers for errors
rather than simply propagating them).

[Do we need wording to this effect?? Or is an AARM note sufficient? - Editor.]

!discussion

Ada.Directories.Create_Path does not specify what happens if the call 
partially succeeds.
If the call manages to create the outer directories associated with the 
path, but fails to
create any of the lower level directories of the path, does the call 
leave the partially
created directories in the file system, or does it remove any 
directories it may have created?
