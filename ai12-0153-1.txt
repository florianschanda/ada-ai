!summary

Boolean-valued aspects default to False.

!question

Boolean-valued aspects have special rules that apply to them, including that the
value can be omitted (and then is True - 13.1.1(15/3)). That doesn't make much
sense unless the default value of the aspect is False. But that is left to the
individual aspects. Should there be a blanket rule for this? (Yes.)

!recommendation

(See Summary.)

!wording

Append to 13.1.1(15/3):

  If an aspect having specifically a boolean type is not specified (directly
  or by inheritance) then it has the value False.

AARM Ramification: The second rule is carefully worded so it only applies to
aspects that are defined to have a boolean type, but not to aspects that are 
defined to have some type that *might* be boolean. For instance, this rule
does not apply to aspect Default_Value.

[Editor's note: We might want to change the wording of the first rule of this
paragraph the same way. Then we could get rid of the awkwardly worded rules
for Default_Value (3.5(56.3/3)) and Default_Component_Value (3.6(22.2/3))
that override that rule. A similar change for 13.1.1(34/3) would allow us to
delete 3.5(56.4/3) and 3.6(22.4/3).

If we treat the new wording like the two existing rules of 13.1.1(15/3) and
13.1.1(34/3), then we need additional wording in 3.5 and 3.6 to cancel its
effect. Which suggests none of these rules are as quite "blanket" as expected.]


[Editor's note: None of the below changes the RM, only the AARM.]

Marks as redundant wording in B.1 (Import and Export):
  "; if not directly specified, the Import aspect is False"
  "; if not directly specified, the Export aspect is False".
   
Same for Unchecked_Union (B.3.3):
  If not specified (including by inheritance), the aspect is False.

Same for Asynchronous (E.4.1 - two places):
  If not specified, the aspect is False.
  If not specified (including by inheritance), the aspect is False.

Same for Inline (6.3.2):
  Redundant[This aspect is never inherited;] if not directly specified,
  the aspect is False.

Same for No_Return (6.5.1):
  Redundant[This aspect is never inherited;] if not directly specified,
  the aspect is False.

Same for Pack (13.2):
  If not specified (including by inheritance), the aspect is False.

Same for Interrupt_Handler (C.3.1):
  Redundant[This aspect is never inherited;] if not directly specified,
  the aspect is False.

!discussion

It's weird to have blanket rules that depend on some property not covered
by the blanket rules. We correct that.

OTOH, we leave the text at each aspect defining the default value, because
otherwise it looks like an omission. Casual readers of the Standard are
unlikely to be aware of the blanket rules that apply.

In the case of the three passages which already begin with redundant text, as
in
   Redundant[This aspect is never inherited;]
the only change is to move the closing square bracket so that the entire
sentence is enclosed.

!corrigendum 13.1.1(15/3)

@drepl
The @fa<aspect_definition> associated with a given @fa<aspect_mark> may be
omitted only when the @fa<aspect_mark> identifies an aspect of a boolean type,
in which case it is equivalent to the @fa<aspect_definition> being specified
as True.
@dby
The @fa<aspect_definition> associated with a given @fa<aspect_mark> may be
omitted only when the @fa<aspect_mark> identifies an aspect of a boolean type,
in which case it is equivalent to the @fa<aspect_definition> being specified
as True. If an aspect having specifically a boolean type is not specified
(directly or by inheritance) then it has the value False.

!ASIS

No ASIS effect.

!ACATS test

This rule does not change the meaning of any aspect (we hope), so no tests
are needed.
