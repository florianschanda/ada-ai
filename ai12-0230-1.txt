!summary

A mechanism is proposed to allow tasks, dispatched according to the rules of EDF
(Earliest Deadline First), to control their access to shared protected objects
via the use of the Deadline Floor protocol.

!problem

[Editor's note: Numbers in square brackets here represent references, which can
be found at the end of the !discussion section.]

Ada currently supports EDF scheduling and Protected Object (PO) sharing via an
implementation of the Stack Resource Protocol (SRP). At the 2013 and 2015 IRTAW
Workshops [4,5] it was accepted that the Deadline Floor Protocol (DFP) [1,2,3]
has many advantages over the SRP and that it should be incorporated into a
future version of the language, and that ideally the support for SRP should be
deprecated.

For Ravenscar-like tasks with no self-suspension there is a static relationship
between a task's relative and absolute deadlines. For general tasks the notion
of a minimum relative deadline is needed to enforce the rules for DFP.

!proposal

The DFP has all the key properties of SRP; specifically, causing at most a
single blocking effect from any task with a longer relative deadline, which
leads to the same worst-case blocking in both protocols. However, DFP is
conceptually more straightforward, is easier to implement, and has less run-time
overheads [2,3,6].

Under the DFP, every protected object has a relative deadline equal to the
shortest relative deadline of any task that uses it. The relative deadline of a
protected object is called its deadline floor. All tasks also have a minimum
relative deadline (which will usually be static, just as a task has a base
priority that is usually fixed).

The key idea of the DFP is that the absolute deadline (as used for EDF
scheduling) of a task can be temporarily shortened while accessing a protected
object. Given a task with absolute deadline d that accesses a resource with
deadline floor DF at time t, the absolute deadline of the task is (potentially)
reduced according to d := min(d, t+DF) while holding the resource.

The action of the protocol on a single processor with tasks that do not
self-suspend results in a single block per task, deadlock free execution and the
protocol works for nested calls on protected objects (PO). While a task accesses
a PO its deadline is reduced so that no newly released tasks can preempt it and
then access the PO. See [1,2,3] for details and proof of the key properties.
This is equivalent to the use of a priority ceiling; again the only tasks that
can preempt a task executing within a protected object are tasks that are
guaranteed not to use that object (unless there is a program error, which can be
caught at run-time).

As with the priority ceiling protocol, an actual lock is not strictly required
to provide mutual exclusion for POs when a single processor is used and tasks
are well behaved (e.g. do not self-suspend while executing within a PO, and have
the correct relationship between relative deadline and absolute deadline).
However, due to the common use of multiprocessors, and the requirements for
resilience, a lightweight mutex lock is proposed for DFP (this was the
recommendation from the discussion at the last IRTAW [5]).

With restricted tasks that conform to the Ravenscar Profile, and which do not
self-suspend, the Minimum_Relative_Deadline would be identical to the usual
Relative_Deadline parameter. But for tasks that do self-suspend a distinct
aspect would be beneficial.

To embed the rules for the DFP within Ada, the following issues must be
addressed:

1) All tasks must have a minimum relative deadline assigned via an aspect or a
   routine defined in a library package.

2) Protected objects must have also a relative deadline (floor) assigned via an
   aspect.

3) Default relative deadline values must be defined for tasks and protected
   objects (and their types).

4) Rules for EDF scheduling must be extended to include a new locking policy:
   Deadline_Floor_Locking (ÒFloor_LockingÓ by itself could be confusing).

5) Rules for EDF scheduling need simplifying to remove the Ôacross prioritiesÕ
   feature of the current definition.

6) For completeness (and parity with priority ceilings) means of modifying the
   relative deadline attribute of tasks and protected objects should be defined.

Each of these topics will now be covered.

1)
The easiest way to introduce minimum relative deadlines to tasks is via the
addition of new items to Ada.Dispatching.EDF:

with Ada.Real_Time;
with Ada.Task_Identification;
package Ada.Dispatching.EDF is
  .....
  subtype Relative_Deadline is Real_Time.Time_Span;
  Default_Minimum_Relative_Deadline : constant
      Relative_Deadline :=
      Real_Time.Time_Span_Last;
  procedure Set_Minimum_Relative_Deadline
     (D : in Relative_Deadline;
      T : in Ada.Task_Identification.Task_Id :=
      Ada.Task_Identification.Current_Task);
  function Get_Minimum_Relative_Deadline (T :
      Ada.Task_Identification.Task_Id :=
      Ada.Task_Identification.Current_Task)
      return Relative_Deadline;
end Ada.Dispatching.EDF;

In would make sense for the existing subprogram, Delay_Until_And_Set_Deadline,
to be modified to take the task's Minimum_Relative_Deadline aspect as the
default value of Deadline_Offset.

A simple means of delaying a sporadic task on an entry and have its absolute
deadline assigned when the task is next released will be necessary.

2)
Each PO needs a Deadline_Floor attribute that can be set on the creation of a PO
by an aspect. The Relative_Deadline aspect already exists, so can be reused to
set the deadline floors. This is identical to the way that the priority aspect
is used both for task priority and PO ceiling priority.

3)
Default_Deadline : constant Deadline :=
  Real_Time.Time_Last; -- already defined
Default_Minimum_Relative_Deadline : constant
  Relative_Deadline :=
  Real_Time.Time_Span_Last;
Default_Deadline_Floor : constant Relative_Deadline :=
  Real_Time.Time_Span_Zero;

4) and 5)
Currently, EDF dispatching is supported via the policy EDF_Across_Priorities. A
range of priorities is needed to account for the different priority ceilings
needed for the protected objects. The tasks themselves only execute at the base
priority of this range when they are not executing within a protected action.
All ready queues are ordered by the (absolute) deadline of the ready tasks.

To prevent confusion, and to emphasize the fact that with the new protocol only
a single priority is needed for all EDF dispatched tasks (regardless of the
number of protected objects they use), it is proposed to have a new dispatching
policy. And to accommodate hierarchical dispatching the new policy is defined as
EDF_Within_Priorities.

Wording is not yet attempted as agreement in principle is needed and a number of
other issues need to be considered such as whether deadline inheritance should
occur during a rendezvous and task activation, and whether entry queues can be
deadline ordered.

With EDF_Within_Priorities, all tasks with the same priority compete for the
processor using the rules for EDF dispatching. The ready queue is ordered by
active deadline. A collection of EDF dispatched tasks and the set of protected
objects they use/share will all have the same priority (and ceiling priority).
But they will have different relative deadlines (and deadline floors).

A task that has not been given an explicit deadline or relative deadline will
get the default values of Default_Deadline and
Default_Minimum_Relative_Deadline. The default value for the deadline floor of
any protected object is 0 (actually Time_Span_Zero). This will have the effect
of making all protected actions non-preemptive, as does the default priority
ceiling (unless tasks are released with deadlines in the past).

Locking policies are applied to a whole partition using the Locking_Policy
pragma. The ARM defines the single policy Ceiling_Locking. As deadline floor
locking is orthogonal to ceiling locking, the two could be used together (in
hierarchical scheduling where there is both fixed priority and EDF dispatching).
Indeed the definition of Ceiling_Locking could be expanded to include the rules
for the deadline floor protocol. However, to make the definition of the new
protocol clearer a new locking policy is defined: Deadline_Floor_Locking. But
note that Ceiling_Locking and Deadline_Floor_Locking can be used together (and
may need a new locking policy that is both ceiling and floor locking Ñ see
!discussion).

Just as a task has a base and active priority, with EDF_Within_Priorities and
Deadline_Floor_Locking a task has an active (absolute) deadline and a base
(absolute) deadline. The dispatcher uses active deadline to determine execution
order.

The rules for EDF_Within_Priorities with Deadline_Floor_Locking are as follows:

o Whenever a task is executing outside a protected action, its active deadline
  is equal to its base deadline.

o When a task executes a protected action its active deadline will be reduced to
  (if it is currently greater than) 'now' plus the deadline floor of the
  corresponding protected object; 'now' is obtained via use of the real-time
  clock (i.e. the clock that supports the Ada.Real_Time library package).

o When calling a protected entry or procedure a lock is obtained on the
  associated protected object.

o When a task completes a protected action its active deadline returns to the
  value it had on entry, and the lock is released.

o When a task calls a protected operation, a check is made that (absolute
  deadline - release time) of the task is not less than the deadline floor of
  the object. On a uniprocessor the lock should also be available. Program_Error
  is raised if this check fails.

With this definition of a new locking policy, the definition of Ceiling_Locking
can return to its pre-2005 wording.

6)
In the same way that a protected object can contain code to change its ceiling
priority - to take effect when the calling task exits the protected object, it
can have its deadline floor updated by an assignment to the Relative_Deadline
attribute. A task can also change its minimum relative deadline.


!wording


!discussion

Much discussion concerning the Deadline Floor protocol can be found in the
references [1,2,3].

One of the advantages of the new EDF_Within_Priorities policy is that it unifies
Ada's use of priority as the primary dispatching policy. It is no longer
necessary to reserve a range of priorities for a single EDF domain. If we ignore
the non-preemptive policy, we now have a clear means of supporting mixed
scheduling in a hierarchical manner:

o At all times, the task at the head of the highest priority non-empty ready
  queue is the one chosen to be executed.

o Each ready queue has its own discipline to determine which task is at its
  head.

The disciplines supported are: FIFO, Round Robin (RR) and now EDF; i.e.
FIFO_Within_Priorities, Round_Robin_Within_Priorities, and
EDF_Within_Priorities.

Tasks with different priorities and different dispatching policies can share
access to protected objects by a combination of Ceiling_Locking and
Deadline_Floor_Locking. When a task enters such a PO its active priority is
raised to the ceiling value and its active deadline is reduced to the floor
value.

The attached AI [this is version /01 of the AI - Editor] comes from prolonged
consideration by the real-time folk on support for EDF scheduling; in particular
the issue of sharing protected object effectively. A new protocol, the
Deadline-Floor Protocol (DFP), has been developed that is consider to be better
than the Stack Resource Protocol (SRP) on which Ada is based.

The attached AI starts the process of moving DFP into Ada (and removing SRP).

I am sure there will be comments!

I assume Randy will give this a number etc.
Looking forward to dicussions

The AI says/claims this, but does not explain what this benefit for tasks that
self-suspend actually is. And yet, this seems to be crucial for the merits of
the proposal, since my cursory reading so far created the impression that rather
than talking (higher) ceiling priority, we are now reading (lower) deadline
floor, and as one is the inverse of the other, nothing really has changed except
words of explanation.

So what is this benefit that warrants the change?

There are really no benefits of tasks that self-suspend. All real-time
abstractions for tasks assume that they do not self suspend. Hence the abstract
definition of the deadline-floor protocol assumes that they do not.

However, as you know, programmers can do what they wish, so for programs that
have tasks that do self-suspend the protocol has to be resilient.

So the point of the Deadline-floor protocol is to give a much easier to
understand and efficient means for real-time tasks dispatched via EDF to share
access to protected objects. Self-suspension is not really an issue (just needs
to be covered in the definition).

> The attached AI comes from prolonged consideration ...

A few thoughts on the AI noted upon skimming it while filing it:

(1) The AI states "... and that ideally the support for SRP should be
deprecated."

But the rest of the AI is written as if the support for SRP will be completely
removed. "Deprecation" in Ada means "moving to Annex J"; we almost never remove
anything.

We might be able to make an exception in this case (since I don't know of any
implementations that actually support EDF, so there is no possibility of
breaking existing code by removing the previous version -- but that has to be
verified, not just asserted by someone).

In any case, the AI seems to go beyond the IRTAW recommendation (which certainly
does not suggest removal). Has the IRTAW position changed (in which case the AI
should say that)? Or is this just the author going beyond the recommendation??
Surely it matters whether obsolescence or removal is proposed, and the AI needs
to be crystal-clear on which is proposed and needs a very strong justification
for removal if that is the recommendation.

(2) There's no such thing as a !reference section. These !thingys are intended
(and used) by various automated tools; one does not get to create new ones
without involving the editor and ARG (because the number of tools that would
need updates). I put the references at the end of the !discussion section and
added a note to point out that they're there.

I'll also note that AIs are not papers! Since there are no URLs associated with
the references, there's no useful way to refer to them. So if I, for instance,
wanted to read about the justification for these changes, it would be impossible
(in my case, I do have the Ada Letters issue somewhere, but one can hardly
assume that). In such a case, one would hope that more of the justification
would make it into the AI proper. (Nothing wrong with referencing something
outside for details, but it seems wrong to give no idea at all.)

(3) The proposal seems to be adding another locking policy. In such a case,
you'll have to explain how that policy works with all of the other existing
protocols (since one specifies locking policy and dispatching policy
separately). Moreover, that's critical if one wants to support mixed EDF and
FIFO policies via Priority_Specific_Dispatching -- since locking policies are
partition-wide. (Unless you want to define Priority_Specific_Locking!!)

(4) "Wording is not yet attempted as agreement in principle is needed and a
number of other issues need to be considered such as whether deadline
inheritance should occur during a rendezvous and task activation, and whether
entry queues can be deadline ordered."

The first part is fine at this stage, but I don't understand the "other issues"
part. If IRTAW doesn't know what should happen, how the heck are na‹ve ARG
members such as myself supposed to figure it out? Sounds like the blind leading
the deaf or something like that. :-)
