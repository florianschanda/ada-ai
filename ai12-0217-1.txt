6.1.1(27/3) should allow some indexed and selected components as the
prefix of potentially unevaluated Old attribute references.

!question

6.1.1(27/3) requires that the prefix of an Old attribute_reference that is
potentially unevaluated statically denotes an object. "Statically denotes"
does not allow any indexed or selected components.

The intent of this rule is to prevent dependence on names whose evaluation
might raise an exception, especially in the case where the cause of the
exception is tested. For instance, if D is a Boolean discriminant of Rec, and
N is a component of Rec that depends on D, then we want the following to be
illegal:

    procedure P03 (R : in out Rec)
       with Post => (if R.D then R.N'Old = 1); -- Illegal

If we allowed this, the user might expect the test of the discriminant to
prevent problems, but the prefixes of the Old attribute are evaluated
unconditionally (since the compiler can't be certain of the value of the
discriminant).

But we shouldn't be disallowing the use of components that don't depend on
discriminants in such contexts:

    procedure Foom (K : in Kind; P : in out Rec)
       with Post => (if K = C then P.C = P.C'Old); -- (1)

(1) is illegal by the current rules (P.C does not statically denote an
object).

This seems too fierce; it is likely to be an annoyance to users where Ada
is unnecessarily nagging them.

Should this rule be relaxed? (Yes.)

!wording

Add after 6.1.1(24/3):

A name *statically names* an object if it:
    * statically denotes the declaration of an object Redundant[(possibly
      through one or more renames)];
    * is a selected_component whose prefix statically names an object, there
      is no implicit dereference of the prefix, and the selector_name names a
      component that does not depend on a discriminant; or
       AARM Note: We disallow components that depend on a discriminant so that
          no discriminant checks are needed to evaluate the prefix.
    * is an indexed_component whose prefix statically names an object, the
      object is statically constrained, and the index expressions of the
      object are static and have values are within the range of the index
      constraint.
[Author's note: The selected_component case seems to be the important one;
if the indexed_component case seems too complicated, we should just drop it.]

Modify 6.1.1(27/3):

The prefix of an Old attribute_reference that is potentially unevaluated shall
statically {name}[denote] an object.

!discussion

The basic idea is that we want to allow any prefix of 'Old that cannot raise
an exception when evaluated. (Note that we're talking about the evaluation
of the prefix itself, not the evaluation of the value of the prefix; an
invalid value can always raise an exception.) In order to do that, we define
a new term (as it has to be recursive) that allows selected_components that
don't include implicit dereferences and do not depend on a discriminant,
and indexed_components with static indexes where the object is statically
constrained.

Other names could have been allowed (for instance, a dereference of a null
excluding access subtype), but we don't want to make this too complicated.

Note that there is no actual bug here: we are not allowing anything that
causes a problem, and there is a workaround to any case that this enhanced
rule will allow (since there must be a prefix that is a statically denoted
object, one can use 'Old on that prefix -- but that could be expensive
if the prefix is a large object).

No ASIS effect.

I'm writing an ACATS test for the last sentence of 6.1.1(27/3).

In order to do this properly, I looked up the definition of "statically
denotes". That is given in 4.9(14-17):

  A name statically denotes an entity if it denotes the entity and:

    * It is a direct_name, expanded name, or character_literal, and it denotes a
      declaration other than a renaming_declaration; or

    * It is an attribute_reference whose prefix statically denotes some entity;
      or

    * It denotes a renaming_declaration with a name that statically denotes the
      renamed entity.

  AARM Ramification: Selected_components that are not expanded names and
  indexed_components do not statically denote things.

------------

This definition means that a selected component never statically denotes
something, even if there is no dereference and the component in question does
not depend on a discriminant. Similarly, an indexed component never statically
denotes something, even if the index expression is static.

Taken literally, this rule seems too fierce. The purpose of the 6.1.1(27/3) rule
is to make it unnecessary to evaluate the prefix in these contexts. As such,
there is no problem with indexed components with a static index expression, or
with a selected component for a normal record component (that is, one that
doesn't need a dereference and that does not depend on a discriminant).

The record component case in particular seems fairly likely in
postconditions:

    procedure Foom (K : in Kind; P : in out Rec)
       with Post => (if K = C then P.C = P.C'Old); -- Illegal by current rules.

Please note that there is nothing actually wrong with the current wording, in
that no problematic cases are being allowed, and there is a sensible workaround
(at least in this case).

However this strikes me as one of these cases where Ada is being picky in a way
that is likely to annoy users. We have these cases which are not problems being
made illegal just because it was easiest to do so. Note that in the similar case
in 6.4.1, we defined a term to avoid a similar problem with those rules.

If we wanted to fix this, we'd need to define an additional term, say
"statically name".

A name statically names an object if it:
    * statically denotes the declaration of an object Redundant[(possibly
      through one or more renames)];
    * is a selected_component whose prefix statically names an object, there is
      no implicit dereference of the prefix, and the selector_name names a
      component that does not depend on a discriminant; or
       AARM Note: We disallow components that depend on a discriminant so that
          no discriminant checks are needed to evaluate the prefix.
    * is an indexed_component whose prefix statically names an object and whose
      index expression(s) are static and whose values are within the range of the
      associated index subtype.

The prefix of an Old attribute_reference that is potentially unevaluated shall
statically name an object.

This wording would allow the above as well as more complex names:

    procedure Foom (K : in Kind; P : in out Rec)
       with Post => (if K = A then P.A(Arr'First) = P.A(Arr'First)'Old); -- Illegal by the current rules, allowed by the above.

---

Unless we decide to change this rule, I will test it literally. (It's important
that compilers do not allow too much so that code is portable.) So I'd like to
know sooner rather than later whether we intend to relax this rule.

At first the current rule seemed reasonable, but looking at our test code base I
notice several uses of selected components and indexed components with
non-static indices in postconditions. In particular, in postconditions for array
subprograms it is common to have a quantified expression over elements of the
input array (which is in turn a component of a larger structure). So a more
permissive rule might be preferable, in particular for SPARK users.

Most sensible quantified expressions using 'Old are illegal by the second
sentence of 6.1.1(27/3), regardless of what relaxation we do here. In
particular, the prefix of 'Old can't include the loop parameter of a quantified
expression. (That happens because 'Old is handled textually, so there is only
one for the entire quantified expression, and that clearly can't handle a
varying value.)

That is:
     Post => (for I in 1 .. 10 => Table(I)'Old = Table(I)); is illegal and that
     wouldn't change by the proposed change.

But I would expect selected components to be common, and since there is no
problem with them so long as no discriminant check is needed, I do think those
should be allowed. And once we do that, we might as well allow some indexed
components as well.

The basic purpose of this is rule is to avoid problems with 'Old prefixes that
the program might want to not evaluate (thus appear in a conditional context);
any prefix that might raise an exception (and thus need to be conditional) needs
to be disallowed. But any prefix whose evaluation can't raise an exception ought
to be allowed, lest we annoyingly prevent useful cases that could not possibly
be a problem.

Indeed, all the examples I’ve seen have the form  Array_Object’Old (I)  where
i is the loop parameter. However the object is often a component of a larger
structure, so the selected component case seems more important.

I don't see that.

I think it should be illegal.  P.C'Old might be invalid if the 'if' condition
is false.

But now that I think about it, (if K = C then P = P'Old) which is currently
legal, has the same problem.

You're trying to capture the idea of "an indexed component that is known (at
compile time) not to raise an exception".  I don't think the above quite
works, because the index subtype might be nonstatic, and anyway, what
matters is the bounds of the object, which also might be nonstatic.  And
there's the same problem with invalid data, which can also raise exceptions.

Seems to need rethinking.

My understanding was that the rule was intended to prevent cases where the
evaluation of the prefix might raise an exception, especially those that
might have been prevented with a conditional.

The ACATS test I wrote has

    procedure P03 (R : in out Rec)
       with Post => (if R.D then R.N'Old = 1);             -- ERROR: A1 {34;6}

as one of the motivating examples (R.D being a boolean discriminant, and R.N
a component that depends on that discriminant).

I don't think there was any intent to try to avoid issues with evaluating the
*value* of some Old attribute. That seems impossible, as any object might have
an invalid value in some part. Any use of 'Old seems to be at risk of that.

I just find it bizarre that

    procedure P99 (K : in Kind; R : in out Rec)
       with Post => (if K = Unchg then R.D'Old = R.D);

is illegal (D being a discriminant). R'Old.D is legal in this case, but why
annoy users with that sort of nagging?

I would agree we should try to be more flexible with 'Old's that appear in
potentially unevaluated contexts.
