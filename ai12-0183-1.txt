!summary

This AI corrects minor errors in the Standard.

1) Add Ordered_FIFO_Queuing to D.4(4).

2) Be specific about which policy is defined in 9.5.3 and 9.7.1.

!question

1) AI12-0163-1 defines policy Ordered_FIFO_Queuing. But the Legality Rule
D.4(4) does not allow that as a policy name. Should it? (Yes.)

2) D.5(7/2) says "The rules for this policy are specified in 9.5.3 and 9.7.1."
This paragraph defines three queuing policies. "This" in this text refers to
that last one mentioned (I think), but that's ambiguious. Should we be specific
here? (Yes.)

!recommendation

(See Summary.)

!wording

[Editor's note: The following changes are included in the draft RM, even though
it is not intended for the full ARG to take up this AI until just before the
next document (an Amendment?) is submitted to WG 9. This AI is only used to
record wording changes that appear to the editor to be obvious improvements
in the Standard.]

1) Modify D.4(4):

   The policy_identifier shall be either FIFO_Queuing, {Ordered_FIFO_Queuing,
   }Priority_Queuing or an implementation-defined identifier.

2) Modify D.5(7/2) [as modified by AI12-0163]:

   Three queuing policies, FIFO_Queuing, Ordered_FIFO_Queuing, and
   Priority_Queuing, are language defined. If no Queuing_Policy pragma applies
   to any of the program units comprising the partition, the queuing policy
   for that partition is FIFO_Queuing. The rules for {the FIFO_Queuing}[this]
   policy are specified in 9.5.3 and 9.7.1.

!discussion

1) This is a clear omission from AI12-0163-1. Obviously, if we define a queuing
policy, we have to allow it to be used in the Queuing_Policy pragma, else it
would be the most useless Ada construct ever.

2) The other two queuing policies are defined in this subclause, so it's fairly
obvious that "this" must refer to FIFO_Queuing. But it shouldn't be necessary
to read the entire subclause in order to figure that out.

!corrigendum D.4(4)

@drepl
The @i<policy_>@fa<identifier> shall be either FIFO_Queuing, Priority_Queuing or
an implementation-defined @fa<identifier>.
@dby
The @i<policy_>@fa<identifier> shall be either FIFO_Queuing, Ordered_FIFO_Queuing,
Priority_Queuing or an implementation-defined @fa<identifier>.

!corrigendum D.4(7/5)
