!subject Reading the default value of a subtype
!summary

An attribute Default_Value is defined for scalar subtypes. It has the type
of the subtype and returns the specified default value if any.

!problem

It is not possible to determine the default value of a type. This can be
useful to determine whether values have been initialized, for instance.

!proposal

(See summary.)

!wording

Add after 3.5(15) [Author's note: This is before the first of the function
attributes][Editor's note: I thought that the appropriate place was just
before the image attribute, after all of the important ones (3.5(27)); not
a big deal either way]:

S'Default_Value
    S'Default_Value denotes the value of the Default_Value aspect of the
    type of S.

S'Has_Default_Value
    If the type of S has the Default_Value aspect defined, then
    S'Has_Default_Value returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Add after 3.5(55.4/4)):

Legality Rules

It is illegal to evaluate S'Default_Value when the type of S does not have
the Default_Value aspect defined. If this Legality Rule is violated in an
instance of a generic unit then Program_Error is raised at the point of the
violation.

[Editor's note: I'd borrow the wording from 3.2.4(26/3) and 3.2.4(29.1/4) for
the above, as that is the closest analog in the Standard. The second sentence
is close (but it should be under Dynamic Semantics); the first is very
different for no obvious reason.]

Add after 3.6.2(10):

A'Default_Component_Value
   For an array with a scalar component type, A'Default_Component_Value
   denotes the value of the Default_Component_Value aspect of A.

A'Has_Default_Component_Value
   For an array with a scalar component type, if A has the
   Default_Component_Value aspect defined, then
   A'Has_Default_Component_Value returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Legality Rules

It is illegal to evaluate A'Default_Component_Value when A does not have
the Default_Component_Value aspect defined. If this Legality Rule is
violated in an instance of a generic unit then Program_Error is raised
at the point of the violation.

!discussion

It's a little odd that you can set this value but not read it. We didn't
provide a way to read it because there is no sensible value to return
if it is not set. It seems that there are two ways to handle the case
of the value when the aspect is not set:

(1) Have the value returned by the attribute to be unspecified (but inside
the base range of the type); or

(2) Make the aspect illegal if it is not specified. We'd need a runtime
check similar to the one for 'First on a subtype with a predicate, so that
we don't have a contract model violation for formal scalar types.


Note that the pragma Normalize_Scalars has a similar effect to specifying
the aspect Default_Value. It would be useful if the attribute could return
the actual default value in that case (but that is a nice-to-have as opposed
to a requirement). [Aside: One wonders if Normalize_Scalars should be
defined in terms of implicitly setting the aspect Default_Value to a value
in the base range of the type but (hopefully) outside of the subtype constraint
of the type. Allowing invalid values might be tricky, but useful even for
explicit settings.]


This can be worked around with some planning. That is, ensure that the
default value is set to a named constant and not just a value:

My_Default_Int_Value : constant := 0;

type My_Integer_Type is new Integer
  with Default_Value => My_Default_Int_Value;

!example

   pragma Assert ((for all I in 1..10 => A(I) /= S'Default_Value));

!ASIS

** A new ASIS attribute kind is needed **

!ACATS test

An ACATS C-Test is needed (and a B-Test if there are any illegal cases).

In general it would be easier for the user if an attribute were associated
with all aspects for which it makes sense.

I much prefer being explicit here, hence the attribute.  Also, this would
look like a deferred constant.

It would also be consistent to allow "<>" as the initial value, but we seem
to have considered that syntax and rejected it several times.

Actually, not illegal in the spec of a package.  It would be a deferred
constant in that context.

> ... but I feel that an attribute would be preferable.

Agreed.

Mmmm...  Tucker seemed to have got it ok, I got it bounced back - twice in

Hello.  I've been trying to write a program from scratch as if Ada 2012 had
been available from the outset, and first new feature that I've found to be
useful is default values for scalars. My little program sets up a table of
values, and at the end I wanted to do a check that all entries had been set
to something (i.e. didn't still contain the default value).

But how do I obtain the default value?  Do we need an attribute
S'Default_Value?

Alternatively I could declare a constant of the type and hope that it picks
up the default value, but that appears to be illegal without an initialisation
expression.  It looks odd, but is there any reason to disallow constants
without an initialisation expression as long as all components have defaults?
(I now expect to be shouted at!)

type My_Integer_Type is new Integer
  with Default_Value => 0;

My_Integer : constant My_Integer_Type; -- Illegal


The easy work around is

My_Default_Int_Value : constant := 0;

type My_Integer_Type is new Integer
  with Default_Value => My_Default_Int_Value;

but I feel that an attribute would be preferable.

This might have been discussed before, but what about applying these attributes
to record components?

****************************************************************

Default_Component_Value was added at Madrid.  Presumably record components
would similarly be limited to components of a scalar type.
We'd have to invent some syntax such as:

S.<component_name>'Default_Value

But then we ought to have corresponding syntax for setting the default value
(in addition to the current method), such as:

with <component_name>.Default_Value => ...
or
with Default_Value (<component1_name> => ..., <component2_name> => ..., ...) (I
quite like that second alternative).

I think this would be venturing into a new AI.

I don't think we say for 'First or 'Last that the attribute cannot be set by
the user (as an attribute, of course the user sets it when he defines the
range of whatever it refers to).
