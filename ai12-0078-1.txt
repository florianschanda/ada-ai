!subject Definition of node for tree container is confusing

!summary

The root node of a tree does not have an element.

!question

The introduction to the Tree container the definition of "node" is quite
confusing, as it starts by saying that each node contains an element, but
in fact the root node does not. Should this be clarified? (Yes.)

!recommendation

(See !summary.)

!wording

Modify A.18.10(2/3):

A multiway tree container object manages a tree of [internal] *nodes*,
{comprising of a *root node*, and a set of *internal nodes*} each of which
contains an element and pointers to the parent, first child, last child, next
(successor) sibling, and previous (predecessor) sibling internal nodes. A
cursor designates a particular node within a tree (and by extension the
element contained in that node, if any). A cursor keeps designating the
same node (and element) as long as the node is part of the container, even
if the node is moved within the container.

Modify A.18.10(3/3):

A *subtree* is a particular node (which *roots the subtree*) and all of its child
nodes (including all of the children of the child nodes, recursively). [There
is a special node, the *root*, which] {The root node} is always present and
has neither an associated element value nor any parent node{; it has pointers
to its first child and its last child, if any}. The root node provides a place
to add nodes to an otherwise empty tree and represents the base of the tree.

No ACATS test is needed, as this is just a definitional change (no semantic
change is intended).

!ASIS

No ASIS effect.

Thanks Tuck.  The first paragraph looks fine to me but the second is missing a
} after "root node" and presumably the italics should be kept.
