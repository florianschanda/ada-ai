!summary

The application of the Ravenscar Profile to multiprocessors requires 
one new configuration pragma and one new restriction to be defined to 
ensure that all tasks are assigned to a CPU.

!question

The definition of a profile says (13.12(13/3)):

A profile is equivalent to the set of configuration pragmas that is defined for
each usage profile. 

However, the Ravenscar profile has rules (D.13.1(8-9/3)) that are not associated
with any configuration pragma.

Should one be defined? (Yes.)

!recommendation

(See !summary.)

!wording

Add a new restriction after D.7(10.8/3):

Only_Static_Task_Assignment
    No task has the CPU aspect specified with a non-static expression.
    Each task (including the environment task) that has the CPU aspect
    specified as Not_A_Specific_CPU will be assigned to a single
    implementation-defined CPU. [Redundant:A task without a CPU aspect will
    activate and execute on the same processor as its activating task.]

AARM Proof:
    The processor of a task without a CPU aspect is defined in D.16. 

AARM Reason:
    This restriction prevents any migration of tasks.

AARM Ramification:
    If no CPU aspects are specified, then the program will run on a single
    CPU, as all of the tasks will be activated by the environment task,
    the rules require the same CPU to be used as the activating task.

AARM Implementation-defined:
    The processor on which a task with a CPU value of a Not_A_Specific_CPU
    will execute when the restriction Only_Static_Task_Assignment is in effect.

Add to D.13(6/4), after No_Task_Termination:
    Only_Static_Task_Assignment,

Delete D.13(8.3) and the associated AARM notes.

Add after D.13(10/3) [Notes]:

    When the Ravenscar profile is in effect (via the effect of the
    Only_Static_Task_Assignment restriction), all of the tasks in the
    partition will execute on a single CPU unless the programmer explicitly
    uses aspect CPU to specify the CPU assignments for tasks. The use of
    multiple CPUs requires care, as the guarantees against unbounded priority
    inversion provided by FIFO_Within_Priorities only apply when all of the
    tasks are assigned to the same CPU. 

    It is not recommended to specify the CPU of a task to be Not_A_Specific_CPU
    when the Ravenscar profile is in effect. How a partition executes strongly
    depends on the assignment of tasks to CPUs. In particular, some task
    assignments can cause unbounded priority inversion not expected by the
    single CPU semantics. Allowing the implementation to chose assignments
    exposes the program to risk of future problems caused by changes to the
    the implementation or even just a choice of different options.
    
!discussion

During the discussion of AI12-0048-1, it was pointed out that Ravenscar has special
rules for the assignment of tasks to processors. These rules appear to require that
FIFO_within_Priorities scheduling be ineffective of Ravenscar programs (as it appears
impossible in general for the implementation to assign tasks such that unbounded
priority inversion cannot occur]). [That is possible for some systems of tasks
and priorities, and it can often be done by hand, but the rules require the
system to do it automatically.] It was felt by some that hiding such a significant
change to the priority model in an Implementation Requirement is far too subtle.

At this point, it was noted that Ravenscar is a profile, which is just a collection
of pragmas. But the behavior of D.13(8-9/3) is not tied to any pragma. This is wrong.
Moreover, by defining it as a pragma, both the rules and the effects would be more
visible.

To fix this we add a new restriction Only_Static_Task_Assignment.

We add this restriction to the Ravenscar profile.

D.13(8/3) is deleted; it follows from other rules. The text about "ready 
queues" is obvious (it's the definition of assigning a CPU to a task); 
and the Not_A_Specific_CPU text is moved to the new restriction, along with
the redundant text.

We also add user notes to the Ravenscar profile to note that a Ravenscar program
will always run on a single CPU unless the programmer tasks action with
aspect CPU to define otherwise. We also caution against specifying tasks to have
Not_A_Specific_CPU.

---

It's possible that this new restriction is incompatible with existing
implementations. However, that could only be because they ignored D.13(8/3)'s
requirement that "the processor be defined statically"; specifying a CPU
aspect with a non-static value could not meet that requirement. 

!ACATS Test

Create an ACATS C-Test to check the existence of the new pragma.

There has been discussions on these AIs from within the IRTAW 'community'.
Our views are as follows (note we also looked at AI-0048 as well).

... [Only relevant part here - Editor.]

For Ravenscar the intent is that all tasks are statically allocated to CPUs
(and there is just one Dispatching Domain). And as a Profile, the intent must
be indicated by pragmas (that are then incorporated into the Profile).

The simplest way to enforce static allocation is to:

1) Introduce a configuration pragma that assigns a CPU to the environment task,
   and for Ravenscar, perhaps, force this CPU to be number 1.

All program tasks would then run on the same CPU as the environment task unless
they used the CPU aspect. This is safe unless they used 'Not_A_Specific_CPU'.
So

2) Introduce a pragma that prevents the use of Not_A_Specific_CPU.

These two pragmas should then be added to the Ravenscar Profile.

So if the programmer does nothing else all tasks will run on CPU 1, but they can
use the CPU aspect to do the allocation (just as they assign priorities).

There is some discussion in the AI about priority inversion. For static task
allocation (as in Ravenscar) this is not an issue. It is clear from the
definition of the dispatching model that conceptually all processors have a
distinct set of ready queues. So yes a middle priority task on one CPU can be
preempted while a low priority task on another CPU is running, but that is exactly
what is expected.

Now to the  Implementation Advice D.13.9/3 Here we think this should remain as
Advice. It is really just saying that the conceptual model of a set of ready
queues per processor should form the basic of the actual implementation.
Good advice, but not enforceable in the language

I hope this clears up the points raised (no doubt there will be more). 
Tullio will be at the ARG meeting.
