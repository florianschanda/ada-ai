!subject Expression functions can be declared in a protected_body
!summary

Expression functions and null procedures can be declared in the body of a
protected type.

!question

Is it permissible to use an expression function as the completion of a
protected function? (Yes.)

6.8(2/3) defines an expression_function_declaration as something separate from
a subprogram_declaration, but 9.4(8/1) only allows subprogram_declaration,
subprogram_body, entry_body, and aspect_clause.

!recommendation

(See Summary.)

!wording

Modify 9.4(8/1):

 protected_operation_item ::= subprogram_declaration
     | subprogram_body
{    | null_procedure_declaration
     | expression_function_declaration
     | entry_body
     | aspect_clause

!discussion

It appears to be an oversight that expression functions are not allowed in
a protected body. They are semantically the same as the full declaration
of a function body with a single return statement, so there can be no
significant implementation burden, and there seems to be no reason to
not allow the shorthand in protected bodies.

Similarly, null procedures should be allowed in protected bodies. They
are also semantically the same as a null body for a procedure, and
again there is no reason to not allow the shorthand.

Note that this not only allows expression functions and null procedures
to be completions, but also to declare body-only expression functions
and null procedures. The language already allows that, and while 
a hidden null procedure doesn't seem useful, a hidden function can be used
to encapsulate a complex barrier expression. There seems to be no reason
to require a full body for such a function rather than allowing an expression
function.

Note that we are *not* allowing expression functions or null procedures to
be used in the specification of a protected type or object. These contexts
do not currently allow any sort of body, and there may be implementation
complications in allowing that. (We would need to change at least 9.4(5/1) to
do so.)

[Editor's question: Should we allow that? It would make some sense, especially
for protected types that implement some interface and thus have to create
implementations for routines that they don't need to provide much
functionality. It probably wouldn't be hard to support (worst case, the
body could logically appear in the protected_body), but it doesn't seem
that necessary, either -- the specification of a protected_type is
a very restricted place as to what can be written, so I don't think people
are going to be too worried about an apparent inconsistency with package
specifications - you can't have types or objects in the visible part of
a protected type, either (and types are a significant problem in practice.)]

!ASIS

Probably need to add expression functions and null procedures to the
appropriate list of result types.

!ACATS test

An ACATS C-Test is needed to check that this is allowed. An ACATS B-Test
that expression functions and null procedures are not allowed in the
specifications of protected types also would be useful.

Simon Wright asked the following on comp.lang.ada:

Is it permissible to use an expression function as the completion of a
protected function? (GNAT thinks so).

ARM 6.1(30) distinguishes an expression_function_declaration from a
subprogram_declaration.

6.8(4) allows an expression_function_declaration to be a completion.

9.4(8) says a protected_operation_item can be, inter alia, a
subprogram_declaration or a subprogram body.

[Back to Randy]

I can't think of a good reason not to allow expression functions (and null
subprograms, too, to be consistent) in protected bodies. There's no absolute
requirement to allow either of them, as obviously both have an equivalent full
body, but it seems odd to not allow the shorthands in this context.
(*Especially* if GNAT allows them.)

So I think that expression_function_declaration and null_subprogram_declaration
are missing from syntax for protected_operation_item. When we made these
possible completions, we failed to notice that the list of allowed syntax for
protected operations needs to be changed.

Works for me!  Uniformity seems like a good thing here.
