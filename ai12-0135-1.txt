!subject Enumeration types should be eligible for convention C

!summary

** TBD.

!problem

It is convenient to map C enumeration types to Ada enumeration
types. However, enumeration types are not eligible for
convention C. An implementation can allow enumeration types
to have convention C via B.1(20), but this depends on the
implementer, and thus impacts portability.

!proposal

Allow enumeration types as eligible for convention C (at least).

!wording

** TBD.

!discussion

For some reason, B.1(12-21/3) do not require any scalar types to be
eligible for convention L. Perhaps that is because using the scalar
types in the various interface packages is preferred.

That's not sensible in the case of enumeration types, however. Many languages
have some type similar to Ada's enumerations, and direct mapping should be
supported if possible.

[I don't know whether we should (1) only require such support for C;
(2) require such support for all languages where it makes sense; or
(3) only require it in some limited case (such as when a size is
given for the enumeration type).

Portability says that we ought to support something, but it's unclear if the
Ada compiler has enough information to make the correct mapping.

OTOH, most existing Ada compilers (all of the ones I know of for sure)
support this capability. It's sad that it's not required.]

!ASIS

No impact.

Enumeration types should be eligible for convention C.

There is one difficult thing here:

An enumeration type may be declared as having convention C before its
representation values are specified.

So to work around of this, convention C should become effective only
after enumeration representation clause is met or when it is too late.
(Define "too late" precisely. By the way I do not see in the RM when it is
too late for a enumeration representation clause. Should we start and other
correction procedure to specify when enumeration representation clause is
disallowed, because the enumeration values are already used?)

Note that in GNAT enumeration types are already eligible for convention C.
