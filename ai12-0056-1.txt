!summary

[Editor's note: These changes are included in the draft Standard immediately, as
they are considered non-normative and non-controversal. However, they are not
yet approved, and thus have more risk of change.]

This AI corrects minor errors in the Standard.

1) Add type Frame to the examples in 3.10.

2) Add an example function with an "in out" parameter to 6.1.

3) Replace the second example of 5.2(20), the current one is not legal.

4) Delete excess "and" from 1.1(3/3).

5) "section" should be "clause" in 1.1.2(24/3).

6) "derived_type_declaration" should be "derived_type_definition" in the
syntax font (and have a link) in 3.9(12.4/3).

7) Function Copy in A.18.25(10/3) should return type Tree, not type List.

8) Formal procedure Swap in A.18.26(9.2/3) should have an explicit mode "in"
for its parameters.

9) Add two user notes in 6.2 to point at where the rules about parameter modes
really are.

!question

1) The Next_Frame example in 6.1(39) uses type Frame, which is labeled "see 3.10".
But there is no type Frame defined in 3.10. Should there be? (Yes.)

2) Ada 2012 allows functions to have "in out" and "out" parameters, but the examples
in 6.1 do not show any such function declarations. Should there be one? (Yes.)

3) If one compiles the second assignment in the example of 5.2(20), my compiler
reports "type of aggregate cannot be class-wide". This appears to be correct,
the example is wrong as written. Should it be fixed? (Yes.)

4) 1.1(3/3) has an extra "and" preceding "random number generation". Should it
be deleted? (Yes.)

5) 1.1.2(24/3) starts "Each section is divided into subclauses...", but of
course it is a "clause" that is divided into subclauses. Should this be fixed?
(Yes.)

6) In 3.9(12.4/3), "derived_type_declaration" clearly refers to a syntax
term, but it is not in the syntax font. Should this be fixed? (Yes.)

7) The function Copy declared in A.18.25(10/3) takes a Tree parameter, but
returns a List! There is no List declared in this package; this ought to be
Tree, right? (Yes.)

8) Formal procedure Swap in A.18.26(9.2/3) has no explicit mode on its parameters,
but our style is to always give an explicit mode on procedure parameters. Should
there be an explicit mode "in" here? (Yes.)

9) 6.2 is titled "Formal parameter modes". But nothing in this clause is about
parameter modes other than the introduction 6.2(1) and the note 6.2(13). Should
we do more? (Yes.)

!recommendation

(See Summary.)

!wording

1) Add at the start of 3.10(22/2):

     type Frame is access Matrix; -- see 3.6

2) Add at the end of 6.1(39):

     function Find(B : aliased in out Barrel; Key : String) return Ref_Element; -- See 4.1.5

3) Modify 5.2(20):

     Writer := (Status => Open, Unit => Printer, Line_Count => 60);  -- see 3.8.1
     Next[_Car].all := (72074, null{, Head});  --  see 3.10.1

4) Modify the last sentence of 1.1(3/3):

   Finally, a predefined environment of standard packages is provided, including
   facilities for, among others, input-output, string manipulation, numeric
   elementary functions, [and ]random number generation, and definition and use
   of containers.

5) Modify the start of 1.1.2(24/3):

   Each {clause}[section] is divided into subclauses ...

6) Modify 3.9(12.4/3):

   The function Parent_Tag returns the tag of the parent type of the type whose
   tag is T. If the type does not have a parent type (that is, it was not
   {defined}[declared] by a {derived_type_definition}[derived_type_declaration]),
   then No_Tag is returned.

7) Modify A.18.25(10/3):

   function Copy (Source : Tree; Capacity : Count_Type := 0)
       return {Tree}[List];

8) Modify A.18.26(9.2/3):

      with procedure Swap (Left, Right : {in} Index_Type);

9) Add new notes on either side of 6.2(13):

  {The mode of a formal parameter describes the direction of information transfer
  to or from the subprogram_body (see 6.1).}

  A formal parameter of mode *in* is a constant view (see 3.3); it cannot be
  updated within the subprogram_body.

  {A formal parameter of mode *out* might be uninitialized
  at the start of the subprogram_body (see 6.4.1).}

!discussion

1) The intent is that the examples in the Standard, taken as a whole, are
complete: all of the types and subprograms are defined in (possibly other)
examples. (This principle does *not* apply to examples in AARM notes.)

The use of type Frame in the declaration of Next_Frame violates this principle.
Frame was declared in 3.8 in Ada 83, but it was removed from 3.10 (which is what
3.8 became) in Ada 95. This needs to be corrected.

Note that function Next_Frame is used in examples in 4.1.1 and 5.2, so removing
it and replacing it by a more typical example is not a good idea.

2) The example functions all have "in" parameters, which shows only a subset of
possibilities. We considered replacing Next_Frame (to fix the previous problem)
to have a function with an "in out" parameter without making the example larger,
but that would have required coming up with a new example for 4.1.1. So we just
added a new function here.

The added example includes both an "in out" parameter and an "aliased"
parameter, and is a rather typical use of these in a function that returns a
generalized reference (similar to the uses in the containers packages).

[Editor's Note: We might want to add an abstract routine as well, or make this
one abstract.]

3) The assignment requires a class-wide source object, as the target is
class-wide. But it is not legal for an aggregate to have a class-wide type, so
we have to qualify the aggregate with a specific type, and then convert
that to a class-wide type.

That would require something like:
    Next_Car.all := Car'Class(Car'(72074, null)));  --  see 3.10.1

This is ugly; moreover, these examples are intended to be very simple
(without any conversions) and this surely is not.

Modifying the type of Next_Car would require care as other examples depend
upon it. It wouldn't have to be class-wide to make those examples work, but
then we'd need a new class-wide example. (And it's nice to show that you can
still dereference and access components in a class-wide object.) So that
doesn't seem to be a good idea.

Thus, we replace the example completely with one derived from types Cell and
Link, and the object Next, conviniently defined directly above the Car example.

4) This is just a left-over word from when that sentence was rewritten at the
last moment.

5) This use of "section" was incorrectly changed when "section" was changed
into "clause" and "clause" into "subclause" at the direction of ITTF. The
command inserted claimed to change it from "clause" to "section", exactly the
reverse of what was supposed to happen. (The incorrect command was removed;
the Ada 2012 AARM shows an incorrect change which does not match the Ada 2005
Standard.)

6) This is obviously missing formatting, which has been missing since the
text was inserted into the Ada 2005 Consolidated Standard. But it probably
was mising because there is no such thing as a "derived_type_declaration";
the syntax term is a "derived_type_definition". Then the word "declared"
is also wrong, so it was changed to defined.

An alternative wording was considered:
   (that is, it is not a derived type)
but this would be a bigger change, and it is not as clear that we're talking
about a particular form of type definition. (Not everyone realizes that neither
a private extension nor a formal derived type are a derived type, as they
certainly look like one. See 3.4(1/2) for the definition of a derived type.
This wording depends directly on that definition, as neither of the
previously mentioned types has a parent type; the function ignores them when
determining its result.)

7) This is pretty clearly a cut-and-paste error, as a similar bullet appears
in each of the bounded container sections.

8) Our standard style has modes on all procedure parameters, so this one should
as well.

9) This clause got its name from Ada 83, when it really did define the formal
parameter modes. But the normative rules all have moved away. In order for the
Standard to live up to its name ("Ada Reference Manual"), we at least should
have some references to the actual normative rules. Since a note already
provides one such reference, we add two more notes to give the other two
for the other most important rules.

It was there in the Ada 83 standard (in section 3.8, which was the section on

I should point out that there are other references to Next_Frame in examples
elsewhere in the RM.  So maybe the best thing would be to resurrect the definition
of Frame.

The original definition from RM83 3.8(7):

   type FRAME is access MATRIX;  -- see 3.6

Matrix is still present in 3.6 so that should be OK.

Any idea ?

****************************************************************

From: Adam Beneschan
Sent: Monday, November 12, 2012 11:41 AM

This is another case of a holdover from Ada 83.  The assignment statement to
Next_Car.all was present in the Ada 83 RM, and of course the Car type wasn't
tagged since tagged types didn't exit.  Car got changed to a tagged type in the
Ada 2005 standard but nobody noticed that this made the example in 5.2 illegal.

I'm not sure what the equivalent example would be; it depends on what the
programmer wants to accomplish.  The issue is that Next_Car's type is unknown
(the compiler can't tell statically what the type will be). Because of that, the
compiler can't determine the meaning of the aggregate.  But this isn't legal
either:

   Next_Car.all := Car'(72074, null);

because of 5.2(6); since the type of the left side is unknown, the rules say
that the right side must be able to dispatch based on the tag of the left side.
This:

   Car(Next_Car.all) := (72074, null);

will set the Number and Owner fields in Next_Car.all; if Next_Car.all's type is
some other type derived from Car, then any fields in a record extension will be
untouched.  I can't think of a simple assignment statement that will assign a
Car value to Next_Car.all if its type is Car, and raise a Constraint_Error if
its type is something else.  If that's what is wanted, I think you have to do
something like:

   if Next_Car.all in Car then
      Car(Next_Car.all) := (72074, null);
   else
      raise Constraint_Error;
   end if;

But I'm guessing that the example in 5.2(20) just needs be dropped, unless we
want to find a case involving an access type dereference that isn't
access-to-classwide.  (The Link type in 3.10.1(15) might work.)

From: Randy Brukardt
Sent: Friday, February 22, 2013  3:52 PM

Steve Baird pointed out as an "observation" that 6.2, Formal Parameter Modes,
doesn't actually contain any rules about formal parameter modes; the only
mention of modes is in the non-normative introductory text and in a note.

The actual definitions and important rules for formal parameter modes are in
6.1(18) [the definition]; 3.3(17) [in mode is a constant]; and 6.4.1(12-15)
[out parameters might not be initialized].

Since we usually call this document the Ada REFERENCE Manual, one would hope
that it could be used for - ahem - reference. As such, a section called
"formal parameter modes" ought to at least mention the important rules about
formal parameter modes and provide cross-references, even if it isn't an
appropriate place anymore for the actual rules.

[Aside: This name comes from the Ada 83 standard, where it actually defined
the meaning of these modes. That got moved to 6.1 in Ada 9x, but the name of
the clause remained unchanged.]

We could of course change the name of the clause (to something like "parameter
passing mechanisms"), but then the introduction and note don't really fit.

A better approach is to add notes cross-referencing the other important rules
for "formal parameter modes". Something like (the second note is the one that
already exists):

Notes

{The mode of a formal parameter describes the direction of information transfer
to or from the subprogram_body (see 6.1).}

A formal parameter of mode *in* is a constant view (see 3.3); it cannot be
updated within the subprogram_body.

{A formal parameter of mode *out* may be partially or completely uninitialized
at the start of the subprogram_body (see 6.4.1).}

---

As notes are non-normative, we can add them as part of the presentation AI (thus,
no separate AI is needed).

Obviously, this proposed change does not meet the Duff rule of relevance, so I
have to presume Bob is against it. Is that a general opinion or should I stick
this into the presentation AI??
