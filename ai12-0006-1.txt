!question

3.10.2(13/2) says that the accessibility of an access parameter is that
of the view designated by the actual. What is the accessibility if that
actual is null? (Dunno.)

!recommendation

** TBD.

!wording

** TBD.

!discussion

This rule appears to have been designed for the always null-excluding access
parameters of Ada 95, and doesn't appear to have updated (for this reason) by
Ada 2005.

!ACATS Test

An ACATS C-Test should be created (but this is likely to be low priority).
