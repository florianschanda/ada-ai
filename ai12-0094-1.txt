!question

Is the following legal?

type T is
 access function (A : Integer) return
 access function (A : Float) return Boolean;

One might expect that it is legal, but according to RM "8.1 Declarative Region"
there is a declarative region for T and two declarations of A immediately
within it, which is illegal by 8.3(26/2).

Should we change the definition of "declarative region" to include an
access_to_subprogram_definition?

!recommendation

(See Summary.)

!wording

** TBD.

!discussion

GNAT allows this example (it thinks it is legal).

!ASIS

** TBD.

!ACATS test

Maxim Reznik (reznik@adacore.com) noticed this issue.

Is the following legal?

type T is
 access function (A : Integer) return
 access function (A : Float) return Boolean;

I'd think it should be legal, but according to RM "8.1 Declarative Region"
there is a declarative region for T and two declarations of A immediately
within it, which is illegal by 8.3(26/2).

Should we change the definition of "declarative region" to include an
access_to_subprogram_definition?

GNAT says it's legal.

Yes, I would agree with that change.

Sounds right to me too.

Without this change there would also be questions about factored lists, as in

    procedure P (X, Y : access procedure (Z : in out Integer));

Is there one Z here or two? Pick your poison; without the proposed change
either answer has unpleasant consequences (either the normal equivalence breaks
down or we reject a case where the identifier Z only occurs once (textually)
in the source).

Yes, of course. Clearly an oversight in the LRM.
