!subject Type invariants and default initialized objects
!summary

Type invariants are checked on all objects of the type that are initialized
by default.

!question

7.3.2(10/3) talks of "default initialization" which 
isn't obviously defined (it's not in the index of the Standard).
Was "initialized by default" intended? (Yes?)

!recommendation

(See Summary.)

!wording

Modify 7.3.2(10/3):

After successful [default] initialization of an object of type T that{ is
initialized by default (see 3.3.1)}, the check is performed on the new object;

!discussion

The term "default initialization" is not defined. It makes more sense to
to use a defined term.

Note that this assumes that the rule was intended to apply to all objects
initialized by default (including <> components of aggregates, components of
larger objects, stand-alone objects, etc.). If the rule was only intended to
apply to object declarations, then it needs rewording.

The author has some concern about the ordering rules that get dragged along
with "initialized by default". However, those aren't a problem here, because
this wording only applies "after initialization", and all of the ordering
issues will have been sorted out first.

!ASIS

No ASIS effect.

!ACATS test

This should be tested in the ACATS test that checks that 7.3.2(10/3) is implemented;
a separate test is not needed.
